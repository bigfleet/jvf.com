  <div class="entry-content"><p>When he last came to Houston, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ne/pedrothelion/">Pedro the Lion</a> gave this recommendation to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000G02H/jimvanfleetco-20">Punch Drunk Love</a>, the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>


<blockquote>
It&#8217;s really good&#8230;  It&#8217;s kind of like when you hear a band is going to put out a new record and you hear what&#8217;s it&#8217;s going to be all about, and it&#8217;s a little weird because you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be good, but then it kicks ass.  After Magnolia, I heard he was doing an Adam Sandler movie, and that sounded like about the dumbest thing I had ever heard, but it&#8217;s fucking great.
</blockquote>

	<p>I, too, was shocked by how much I liked this movie.  Towards the conclusion, I was starting to wonder &#8220;Am I going to give this movie five stars?  Seriously?&#8221;</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s the story of Barry Egan, a man who&#8217;s built his own business selling toilet plungers.  He has seven sisters, all of whom seem to take quite a bit of pleasure emasculating Barry, while curiously seeming to care a great deal about him.  I&#8217;m not one to judge whether this kind of behavior makes sense, but it certainly works to make its point in the film.  After all, it&#8217;s Barry&#8217;s story.</p>


	<p>Barry has a lot of problems which all interweave with each other in a way that makes real sense to me.  He is horribly embarrased by certain personal facts about himself and claims ignorance when confronted with actions that need explanations.  He&#8217;s afraid of showing his inner self because he&#8217;s had such horrible luck trusting people.  His sisters, even though they think they&#8217;re acting in his best interest, are part of his problem in that respect.  He&#8217;s forced to trust fairly random people, like a dentist married to one of his sisters, with these massive personal problems.  He also has no judgement in whom to trust, like that dentist incident, and a call to a phone sex line which propels one of the plot lines.</p>


	<p>He&#8217;s painfully nervous when he meets Our Girl, played by Emily Watson.  One of the only deductions I give this movie is that if she and Barry are to have the kind of connection shown in the movie, we need more background about how <strong>she</strong> got there.  This is a minor deduction, because again, this is Barry&#8217;s story.  As he decides what he wants, he becomes a new man, like so many men do when they find themselves in love.  In facing a situation which you suspect might have driven Barry over the edge, one way or the other, instead he faces it down and puts it to rest.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t think I could have handled a non-happy ending to this story, and luckily, I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s hard to know exactly what to give this movie.  Is it one of the best movies ever?  I don&#8217;t exactly want to say so, it seems too peculiar.  Since I happen to be peculiar, that&#8217;s no problem for me, but still.  Is there a way the movie could have been appreciably better?  I don&#8217;t think so.  Did I enjoy the movie?  Very much.  I have to give it a <strong>9.6/10</strong> and tell you to watch it.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305882592/jimvanfleetco-20">Harold and Maude</a> was supposed to be the second half of a Hal Ashby double bill.  The first half was going to be Being There, but unfortunately, I think it sucked.  As it turns out, it was the second half of a double-feature that&#8217;s all about the love.</p>


	<p>As a love story, it&#8217;s strangely pedestrian.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly crazy that a young man could fall for a&#8212;geriatric (<i>giggle</i>) when she&#8217;s so full of life.  He clearly needs that kind of influence badly, and she just effortlessly breaks through his little boy-shield.  After that, he&#8217;ll be hanging on for the rest of the ride.  That much makes sense to me.  It&#8217;s also typically boyish of him to completely miss the references she makes to ending her life throughout the film.</p>


	<p>The humor of the movie is what&#8217;s really exceptional.  The repeated suicide attempts never failed to amuse.  The supporting cast all work.  The no-longer-amused mother, the military general uncle, the psychiatrist (who disconcertingly is dressed exactly the same as Harold in an early scene), they&#8217;re all great.  The humor is what makes this movie a <strong>6.8/10</strong>, instead of something totally forgettable you&#8217;d see on Lifetime.  That&#8217;s a +.2 for Cat Stevens.</p>
