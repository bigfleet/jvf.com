  <div class="entry-content"><p>It turns out this machine is pretty neat.  It takes you about twenty seconds to get used to standing on it, and getting a feel for the body positions that generate the motions involved.  It also makes you realize that what <strong>you</strong> consider to be standing straight up might not be exactly accurate, center of gravity wise.</p>


	<p>So anyway, I avoided disaster.  I spun the thing around pretty well, for how much room the lady was giving me.  You turn it with a little control near your left hand, you lean forward and back to accelerate in that direction.  It can go decently fast, the pace of a brisk jog.  It can go 10-12 miles on a battery charge, and the tires are supposed to last several thousand miles.</p>


	<p>The bad part, as I see it, is where the hell are you supposed to use this thing?  If you&#8217;re a college student, I could see it.  But for that money?  If you&#8217;re in an urban environment, you could use it to get to work.  But only if you lived on the ground floor, and it wouldn&#8217;t get stolen at your place of work.</p>


	<p>I just don&#8217;t feel the early adopter spirit on this one.  Even if I could afford it, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be getting one.</p>


	<p>Now, those mail carriers out in Southwest Houston?  That&#8217;d be a different story.  I&#8217;d be all over that like white on rice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think anyone visiting this site would be shocked to read my suggestion that American Industry and American Government are closely related.  But are you ready for a clearly biased, yet still informative quiz?</p>


	<p>Visit <a href="http://www.progress.org/banneker/igt/cw/">The Corporate Welfare Homepage Quiz</a>.  I scored a 124, which seems to be pretty good.  The quiz is definitely thought-provoking.  Make sure to stick with it at least until you reach the question concerning tax loopholes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>They won&#8217;t end up on <a href="http://db.etree.org/bigfleet">my list</a> for some time yet, but as a combination of downloading and the mail yesterday, these show got added to my incoming shows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Coldcut, DJ Food, and <span class="caps">DJ Z</span>-Trip 12-25-00, Solid Steel Radio</li>
<li>DJ Krush 12-4-01, Live in Rochester, NY</li>

<li>A Tribe Called Quest,  11-24-98</li>
<li>Black Eyed Peas, 12-14-02</li>
<li>De La Soul, 10-28-01</li>
<li>Del The Funkee Homosapien, 11-22-2002</li>
<li>Outkast 7-31-2001</li>
</ul>

	<p>This doesn&#8217;t even include some shows that came in that turned out to be <span class="caps">MP3</span> sourced.   Some of those are new to eTree, which makes me happy.  Any one of those shows above would have made the day feel like a success, so having all of them come in at once was very exciting to me.</p>


	<p>I do have plans for a healthy subsystem of links to musical acts.  In another month, I should be done with my contracting projects, allowing my free time to be my free time.  (Won&#8217;t <strong>that</strong> be something!)  Then I&#8217;ll at least have some time to think about it and see what I can do.  I am definitely all about spreading the musical love.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a good time while I was watching &#8220;The Grifters&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069I1U/jimvanfleetco-20, don&#8217;t get me wrong.  And not just because of Annette Bening&#8217;s boobies, which you see plenty of.  John Cusack is enjoyable as always.  One of the things I like about Cusack is that you can rely on him not to overact.  Crime movies can get trashy in a hurry if that&#8217;s all their characters &#8220;do, say, make, think&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006357T /jimvanfleetco-20.</p>


	<p>This movie steers clear of that problem.  It&#8217;s not a movie about crime, scams, and grifting.  That&#8217;s what the main characters do, but the movie is about them.  You&#8217;ve got two women going after whatever they want, and not being inclined to stop when they encounter resistance.  You&#8217;ve got a guy in the middle convinced he can play it his own way right through this stuff.</p>


	<p>The events at the end really start straining credulity.  I will try never to spoil movies here, so the only thing I&#8217;ll say is that it seems inconsistent that Angelica Huston&#8217;s character would be so thoughtless at time when she&#8217;s so together otherwise.  That, of course, is in the script, not her performace, which is really very good.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll also say that you will enjoy the movie a lot more if you accept, from the very beginning, that Lily (Huston) <strong>is</strong> Roy&#8217;s <cusack> mother.  The climax of the film will be much more exciting than if you&#8217;re waiting the entire movie for a revelation that she&#8217;s not, that it&#8217;s some kind of elaborate con on you, the viewer.</p>


	<p>I give it a solid <strong>7/10</strong>.  It loses two points for the &#8220;So What?/Nothing New&#8221; factor and one point for the questionable wrapup.  Come to think of it, let&#8217;s make it a <strong>7.5/10</strong> with an extra .5 for the cast, which does a great job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many anime that I&#8217;ve enjoyed and will review here eventually:  <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JL4O/jimvanfleetco-20">Macross </a><a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JL4N/jimvanfleetco-20">Plus</a>, <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305014140/jimvanfleetco-20">Ninja Scroll</a>, <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6304493681/jimvanfleetco-20">Ghost in the Shell</a>, and the <a HREF="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000023.php">Escaflowne</a> series which is kick-ass.  They&#8217;re all very enjoyable ways to spend time, going on a fantastic adventure, blah blah blah.</p>


	<p>What Neon Genesis Evangelion does is rare.  It has the ability to surprise.  Believe me, it will surprise you, if you don&#8217;t spend too much time reading reviews and trying to spoil it for yourself.  All the above anime fall into a pattern of sorts:  a hero or a small group of heroes with actual character depth face and overcome obstacles until their eventual triumph.  There are no secrets here, we watch to see <strong>how</strong> they overcome these obstacles, how they change, how they find the strength to do what they do, or even just what happens next.  For the first half of <span class="caps">NGE</span>, you have more or less the same formula.  It even performs very well on this level.  The complications seem impossibly large at times, and they&#8217;re dealt with <strong>nearly every episode</strong>.  You don&#8217;t have Goku going on a Hawaiian vacation for three weeks every time he defeats a mini boss.  You&#8217;ve got teenagers dealing what the aftermath of what, for any real person, would be the most traumatic event of his or her life, then having to break it off and having to go through an even <strong>more</strong> traumatic moment.  And the three kids doing it are all interesting and strange, it&#8217;s all very well done, and very typical.  There are giant robots, all that.</p>


	<p>Then the entire thing blows up in your face, and you realize that you&#8217;re going to be dealing with a challenging piece of art.  When the plans of the Guys In The Shadows start getting real air time instead of just being hinted at, while the battle out on the field is getting more and more out of control, and they really start to come on with the biblical and apocalyptic imagery, you start to realize that this anime is trying to Say Something.</p>


	<p>Then again, at about three-quarters of the way through, they rip the lid the rest of the way off, and leave you scrambling to interpret what&#8217;s taking place.  In the original series, collated with the <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000639E0/jimvanfleetco-20">Perfect Collection</a>, it&#8217;s worth the effort.  Watching &#8216;The End of Evangelion&#8217;, it certainly continues right where the last episodes left off, dealing you wild, difficult to manage images, and mixing it in with this plot that&#8217;s become so Out There, there&#8217;s really no way they could expect you to tie it up all in this little bow, and say &#8220;Here&#8217;s what happened.&#8221;  If you read the reviews, people have all different kinds of ideas about what the endings really signify, but there&#8217;s no one answer.  (I say endings because the final <span class="caps">OVA</span> episode definitely qualifies as an ending.)</p>


	<p>Combined with the thought that went into the making of the series, the fact that you have a job to do as a viewer is a good thing.  There are interesting ideas posed by the parts of the plot no one could mistake.  Even though I don&#8217;t believe that it reflects or captures a <strong>great</strong> deal of meaning for this universe, it certainly makes you think about the reasons <strong>why</strong> it doesn&#8217;t, and the answers are harder than &#8220;Well, women don&#8217;t typically have blood made of poison&#8221; or &#8220;Human minds aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call vulnerable to a <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=518609">buffer overflow</a>.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s must-see viewing, if you can handle the anime genre.  I give the series a <strong>9.8/10</strong> with a .2 deduction for general inscrutability, even though I just defended it.  End of Evangelion gets a <strong>8/10</strong> with a 1 point deduction for being not really necessary viewing, and not being as good as any of the episodes in the last quarter of the series.  Another 1 point deduction for content.  If you&#8217;re going to pretend to be the climax all the way out here in an extra disc which my <strong>$100+</strong> didn&#8217;t buy, you better do a lot better than the dual mind-benders &#8220;Don&#8217;t put the fate of the world in the hands of an insecure teenage boy,&#8221; and &#8220;Boy, insecure teenage boys are fucked up!&#8221;  Didn&#8217;t we all know this.</p>


	<p>Also, if you happen to be a teenage boy reading this, <strong>admit it!</strong>  Let the &#8220;healing&#8221; begin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recipe was the sauce for a Jamaican Jerk sauce.  I&#8217;ll provide it, because I like to share.</p>


	<p>From <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563058669/jimvanfleetco-20">The Barbecue! Bible</a> by Steven Raichlen:</p>


<ul>
<li>2 to 16 scotch bonnet chiles.  Habeneros also work.</li>
<li>2 bunches scallions, white and green parts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
<li>1/2 medium onion, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
<li>1 piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dry</li>
<li>2 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons (kosher or sea) salt</li>
<li>1 tablesppon firmly packed brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Combine the chiles, scallions, onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor and process until finely chopped.</li>
<li>Add the thyme, allspice, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, vinegar, soy sauce, oil, salt and sugar and process to a smooth purï¿½e.</li>
</ol>

	<p>There you go!  That&#8217;s the sauce.  I&#8217;m not going to do the whole recipe, which yields yummy pork tenderloins.  I highly recommend the book, it&#8217;s got plenty of great dishes even for people who eat things beside meat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right.  I finally gave in and started a blog.  Maybe there&#8217;s a chance that the &#8220;small changes&#8221; idea of the blog will actually finally solve my problem of not being able to assemble a ton of content all at once.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be experimenting with the form of things and thinking through the structure I&#8217;d like to have in place here.  But mostly I&#8217;m doing this just to feel good, my past couple of days have really sucked.</p>
