  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, the trip to New York was up and down.  On the up side, I saw and hung out with Dan.  That was fun, and a real throwback to the old days.  We checked out a Jets game, and man, that was something else.  We showed up at the Meadowlands at about 4:30 and had beers, burgers, and dogs until the game at around 9.  The game itself was something else, very exciting.  I loved our seats, which were under the overhang on the lower deck, right at the fifty yard line.</p>


	<p>I got sick on Thursday and found out that Jesse, my best friend from back home in Maryville died.  I spent all of that day in bed and moving my travel schedule around.  Friday I spent at LaGuardia trying to leave.  Saturday, I actually got to leave on the train, cancelling all my flights and stuff.  More on that next post.</p>


	<p>So overall it was nice.  I hope to make it back sometime, but there&#8217;s a few other places on my list first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d been thinking of things to say for months.  I was lucky enough to see him more in the past two months than I had in the past five or six years.  There were things like him getting out of the hospital and cooking me dinner that I thought would work its way into some kind of metaphor for how he treated his illness throughout his life, but it didn&#8217;t.  When it was time to speak at the viewing, all I could think about was my friend and everything we had been through, and I just couldn&#8217;t&#8230; say&#8230; anything&#8230;..</p>


	<p>We were a part of each other&#8217;s happy stories.  He sent me this wonderful e-mail reminding me of the ones he remembered, and I did the same for him.  It turns out that it was just after he had learned that the cancer was back.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m so tired of this.  Can&#8217;t this year end already?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been three weeks since my last post.  Three weeks!  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more sad&#8212;the fact that it&#8217;s been that long or the fact that there really hasn&#8217;t been a development anywhere.  At least, one that&#8217;s any of your business.</p>


	<p>Punks.</p>


	<p>I am headed to New York tomorrow, though, and that should be fun.  More when I get back, and maybe I&#8217;ll be able to drop some science from the road.</p>

<time datetime="2003-11-27T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 27<span>th</span>, 2003</time> - 
        


        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on finding out what I can about this IT organization.  If you guys got to see what I&#8217;m doing, you&#8217;d be thinking &#8220;Our little baby&#8217;s all growns up.&#8221;  I certainly think so when I&#8217;m on the job.</p>


	<p>At first, I was kind of concerned because I had no experience.  But you really don&#8217;t need all kinds of experience sometimes to tell there&#8217;s problems when employees don&#8217;t talk to or respect management decisions.  As I&#8217;ve said a few times in the past couple of weeks, sometimes I&#8217;m amazed that anything happens in this world at all.  Progress sure seems a lot more odd.</p>


	<p>As for the software development side, the really exciting stuff, I got the laptop in and tied all the pieces of my framework together.  Just for shits and giggles, here&#8217;s the pieces:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gentleware.com/">Poseidon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Dreamweaver</a></li>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> of course </li>
<li><a href="http://www.salmonllc.com/sofia/"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a></li>
</ul>

	<p>Everything&#8217;s either <a href="http://www.gnu.org"><span class="caps">LGPL</span></a> or an equivalent, which means that you can use it freely even if you&#8217;re building proprietary software with it.  One metaphor I&#8217;ve seen that I really like referring to the Open Source movement is that it&#8217;s a war&#8212;only in this war when Open/Free software gains ground, it can&#8217;t be regained.</p>


	<p>Since I got everything tied up, things have kind of stalled.  There are many places that I could go next but what I&#8217;d like to do is finally get the requirements document done.  I&#8217;m very excited about the process that I&#8217;m using, almost as much as developing the product.  Products come and go, but if I have a working process, that&#8217;s like a license to print money.</p>


	<p>Maybe.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve got to hit the hay, even with my nap.  I haven&#8217;t packed and I need to split in about twelve hours.  I&#8217;m going to be doing a bunch of reading.  This is shaping up to be one unique vacation.</p>


	<p>Tell you all about it later!</p>

I used a $25 gift card that my dad got last Christmas and gave to me.  It didn&#8217;t come cheap, but it&#8217;s <strong>the hotness.</strong></p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll probably have a full review in mind when I come back from <span class="caps">NYC</span>, but my initial impressions are all quite favorable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Guess who cooked today&#8217;s hit dish?  I can&#8217;t claim all the credit.  Mom had the recipe (bourbon sweet potatos) and helped with the prep.  But I did most of the work!  I also put together the sausage dressing, but that wasn&#8217;t nearly as good.  This was the most I remember enjoying a Thanksgiving in quite some time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It looks like I&#8217;ll be starting my own business as a result of this job.  The company is not withholding tax or social security or anything like that, so it looks like I&#8217;ll be forming a sole proprietorship to take advantage of some of the tax breaks.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve called a couple places around town, and they&#8217;ve just finished a CD which will walk me through the process step by step.  Do you guys have any ideas for a name?  And yes, this is a great chance for a joke at my expense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m getting a new laptop!  Once again, it&#8217;s not technically mine, it&#8217;s being bought by <span class="caps">OPGI</span>.  The next computer I buy for personal use will be an Apple, I vow.  This one would have been an Apple as well, but it appears that one of the tools I&#8217;d like to use for my web application development project will only work on PC.  It&#8217;s written in Java, so one would expect it would work anywhere, but not a lot of people are supporting the tool, and&#8212;really&#8212;what can you do?</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a Dell Latitude 800, and I&#8217;ll love it as if it were my own.  I&#8217;m only checking to see if it&#8217;s finally been boxed every half hour.  Torturous!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, even though my boss said he&#8217;d try not to throw me into the deep end&#8212;there I am!  I&#8217;ve been requested by the QA/QC (that&#8217;s Quality Assurance/Quality Control for the non-droids out there) department head to come take a look at their processes.  So now I&#8217;m glad I read that consulting book!</p>


	<p>In other job news, the miscellaneous web tasks have been no problem.  Work on the web application framework is progressing well, and when I&#8217;m finished, I should have something pretty nice to offer the public.  Yeah, sure, you probably could care less, but I&#8217;ve spent almost a week on it now, so somebody will appreciate the Google search that turns that up!</p>


	<p>But I still love the job.  There&#8217;s so much I&#8217;m learning so quickly&#8230;  I&#8217;ll make my mistakes and take my bumps, but this is a time in my life I can do something like this.  Just work and work like crazy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a <span class="caps">YMCA</span> member!  I signed up a couple days ago, and this morning I had my first workout.  They&#8217;ve got these wild machines that you identify yourself to, and they remember things like where you should put the pegs and seats, and how many reps to do at what weight.  They even beep at you to make sure that you&#8217;re doing the exercize appropriately.</p>


	<p>It also enables this great program they have to keep track of what they call <i>FitPoints</i> which sounds pretty lame, but it gives you immediate positive feedback about your workout.  They also give you cool stuff for racking up the points!  Just to show you it&#8217;s not all about the business model down at the Y&#8230;</p>


	<p>At any rate, I got about 300 with today&#8217;s one circuit on the weight machines and a half-hour cardio session.  I&#8217;ll be headed back tomorrow for more.  I must get that koozie.</p>
