  <div class="entry-content"><p>No matter how you know me or have come to find this page, I would appreciate it if you would take <a href="http://friends.cisv.org/survey/47512444/index.cfm">this brief survey</a>.  It&#8217;s about an organization for which I care very deeply, <a href="http://www.cisv.org/"><span class="caps">CISV</span></a>.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CISV</span> is a wonderful organization with a clear mission: to create peace through the education of children aged 11 to 18 by exposing them to different cultures in neutral environment and caring guidance from adult leaders.  I have been a part of this organization since I was 11 years old.  The world needs our organization more than ever before, and I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could help us get a better idea of how to present our organization to those that have never heard of us before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
	<li>I notice that my readership has almost doubled without my even doing anything.  Congratulations to you all for your delightful lack of taste.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve changed around the sidebar.  Big whoop.  I&#8217;m almost done tagging all of my old posts (did you notice the increase in linkroll traffic?)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>My family is with my sister, helping her to settle in her new environment down in Florida.  She&#8217;s preparing to spend this coming semester at New College of South Florida.  She&#8217;s excited and at the beach&#8212;that&#8217;s a pretty good combo.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I realized that Megan and I saw Mos Def and Talib Kweli this year and didn&#8217;t even blog about it.  I should have my privileges revoked.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am doing a lot of writing at work which is sort of dampening my enthusiasm for writing here lately.  Too bad, because a lot of things have been happening.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am trying to help put the finishing touches on the first major web application written for <span class="caps">CISV</span>.  It&#8217;s being written in Ruby on Rails, and I feel it&#8217;s been going well.  We just need to put some largely finishing touches on it and we&#8217;ll be in good shape.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Megan and I once again had a blast at a show featuring her friend Chris Eldridge.  He is part of <a href="http://www.thestringdusters.com/bio.htm">The Stringdusters</a>  who, as I understand, have been signed to a major label.  They play &#8220;newgrass&#8221;, they say.  Whatever that is.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I feel like I&#8217;ve really found a good place at work&#8212;I seem to be just the kind of person that the company is looking for, and they seem to be the company I&#8217;ve been looking for.  I would be surprised if this wasn&#8217;t my last job for a long time.  After this, I go out on my own in one way or another.  (I may have this job for quite some time.)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m working on a secret project at work, so <strong><span class="caps">OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH</span></strong> aren&#8217;t I special?</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The Notwist are good.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve become part of some sort of nutty geek order; we&#8217;ll see how that turns out.</li>
	</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Normally this would be a linkroll post.  (Are you reading the linkroll?  Megan is!)  In this case, however, I&#8217;m going to make an exception.</p>


	<p>Did you know that the United States <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/01/chinas_reserve_.html">requires 2 billion dollars a day in foreign investment</a>  to continue its current rate of capital consumption.  And that, for some reason, it&#8217;s creditors are willing to put up with a relatively low interest rate <strong>and</strong> devaluation of the dollar on top?</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t read all the economics blogs, but I can tell you, not even they know what this means.</p>


	<p>What I will say is that if you are typically inspired by the behavior of the US, go get that stove on credit!</p>

	<h3>Geek Stuff</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m a gigantic nerd, so it&#8217;s not too much of a surprise that this section is pretty busy.  I
<a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/01/18/whoa">got my first #1 ranking</a> on Google, even though the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hyades+tomcat">current search</a> yields no love.
I started to <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/01/24/geek-cred">really work with open-source operating systems</a>, a trend which continues to the current day.  I&#8217;m posting this from Ubuntu, which I hope to write about soon.  (OK, I&#8217;m not&#8212;but I could have been.)
I drank the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/02/22/i-am-so-sold">Ruby On Rails</a> koolaid, even though I don&#8217;t really see my opinions on it represented on the blogosphere.  I know that because I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/12/an-example">entered it</a> during 2005.</p>


	<p>I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/03/trac-and-txd">anted up</a> for a lifetime of shared hosting at TextDrive.  I should reach break-even next year at some point.  I made that move, in part, to <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/04/what-took-you-so-long">move to a new blogging platform</a>.
And even though it&#8217;s probably of more personal interest, I&#8217;ll include <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/30/a-new-job">getting my new job</a> under this section.</p>


	<h3>Personal Milestone</h3>


	<p>Beyond the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/30/a-new-job">new job</a>, there was the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/11/raise-high-the-roof-beam-carpenters">new house</a> with its ridiculous <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/03/its-official-redux">listing</a>.  There were many trials and tribulations; so many, in fact, that I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/pages/my-first-house">stopped writing about them in the middle</a>, although the concerns are minor in the grand scheme of things.  I couldn&#8217;t be happier with my house, even through all the little nits and picks.  For those of you interested in buying a house, I highly recommend it, especially if there&#8217;s an <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/16/weekly-update"><span class="caps">IKEA</span> nearby to fleece</a>.  Just be prepared for <strong>a lot</strong> of the unexpected.</p>


	<p>While buying the house was not a direct outgrowth of <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/03/09/wheres-my-beer">my desire to increase my financial literacy</a>, my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/25/all-about-the-benjamins">exploration of the real estate market</a> certainly was.  So was <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/25/its-official">starting my first business</a>.</p>


	<p>Also, I celebrated my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/10/19/megan-and-me">first anniversary of dating Megan</a>  with a wonderful <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/11/25/happy-holidays">Thanksgiving</a> and <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/01/01/happy-new-year">Christmas season</a>.</p>


	<h3>And, Finally&#8230;</h3>


	<p>I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/13/my-friend-flickr">got a digital camera</a>.  Hooray!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Our Party</h3>


	<p>Our Not-A-New-Year&#8217;s bash went swimmingly!  Megan was a superstar in getting the place cleaned up and everything ready.  I pitched in with an assist on some things and helped keep her calm. Friends mixed and mingled and appeared to have a great time.</p>


	<h3>New Year&#8217;s Eve</h3>


	<p>We went to Fredericksburg for New Year&#8217;s Eve.  We hung out with Marta, one of Megan&#8217;s friends.  After having a nice dinner, we went back to Marta&#8217;s place for cookies, South Park, sample questions from her brother&#8217;s multi-state Bar exam prep book and some questionable champagne.</p>


	<p>We walked to downtown Fredericksburg to watch the pear drop, but apparently the pear doesn&#8217;t drop anymore;  they just have a laser light show and a ton of confetti.  I really enjoyed that part of the evening.  We spent the night back home in our bed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know, only like two of you care about all this geekery.</p>


	<p>In general, my life is going well.  Megan and I are having a lot of fun, as always.  We&#8217;re gearing up to send invitations out for our holiday party on the 30th.  (Save the date, if you&#8217;re reading&#8230;)</p>


	<p>My job at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERThought</a> has been a challenge, but not in the ways that I expected.  I do feel, thought, that I am beginning to settle there.  I enjoy the people I work with there more than I have since college, so that&#8217;s a big plus.  The job itself still has a lot of unexpected facets, so as I&#8217;m more fully settled, you&#8217;ll hear more from me here.</p>


	<p>With the way I&#8217;ve been feeling, that&#8217;s been enough to pretty much fill my day.  I got my mom a flat-panel monitor for Christmas and her birthday.  She badly needed it for desk control.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting my dad something a little different.  I want to get him blogging since he has a lot of great ideas he&#8217;d love to share, and he&#8217;s looking for a job.  My Mom and Dad have always been very with it, and I want to help bring him up to the cutting edge of the job search sphere.</p>


	<p>(Mom set up her own <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and <span class="caps">SMTP</span> client once.  Beat <strong>that</strong>, other moms!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Before We Begin</h2>


	<p>The point of this lesson is to get you on your feet in an X environment; the basis of any workstation.  You&#8217;ll get an introduction to the ports system and see what it&#8217;s like to use it.  I include a couple of tips for ordering your port installation and a few examples of ports that I&#8217;ve installed at the end.</p>


	<h2> Ports, Explained</h2>


	<p>In the <a href="http//blah/">last lesson</a>, we covered installing the ports system using <span class="caps">CVSUP</span>.  Ports is the package management system for FreeBSD.  It&#8217;s highly dependent on source code compilation, so it&#8217;s not for the impatient.  However, the ports system has high standard for a &#8220;non-broken&#8221; port, and the maintainers of any given port are given continuous feedback for circumstances that &#8220;break&#8221; the port.  As a result, you can use ports without being that comfortable with many of the major compilation issues and strategies;  odds are that it will <em>just work</em>.</p>


	<h2> Using the ports system.</h2>


	<p>The first step I took with my newly installed system was to log in as root and&#8230;</p>


<code>
<pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-servers/xorg-server/
# make install clean
</pre>
</code>

	<p>That&#8217;s it.  Let that run, and eventually you will have an X server running.  The ports system itself will walk the necessary dependency chains, installing other ports as needed.</p>


	<h2> Interlude: configuration and <code>rehash</code></h2>


	<p>After the above command has completed, issue the <code>rehash</code> command.  Essentially, this tells FreeBSD to go back and re-evaluate your <span class="caps">PATH</span>, giving you access to any newly installed programs.  In this case, you&#8217;ve picked up <code>xorgconfig</code>, which you should now run.</p>


	<h2> Getting a bit tricky</h2>


Ports evaluate dependency chains as best it can, but it&#8217;s not a perfect system.  For example, if we were to&#8230;
<code><pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/gnome2
</pre></code>
we could <code>make install clean</code> immediately, but let&#8217;s say we were going to sleep after issuing that command.  During the middle of the night, this command would end up blocking on configuration choices for the <code>ghostscript</code> port.

	<p>So you don&#8217;t wake up to yummy Gnome!  The answer, in this case, is to install the <code>print/ghostscript-gpl</code> port first (which doesn&#8217;t take very long) then start gnome.</p>


	<p>(KDE, by the way, blocks on at least a half-dozen dependencies. <code>artswrapper, postgres-client (?!?), openslp, kdegraphics, kdemultimedia, kdepim, and boost-python</code>)</p>


	<p>There are ways to have these preferences taken into account without having them come up directly in the <code>make</code> process, but I&#8217;m still experimenting with the alternatives and trying to figure out how some of the tricky stuff works.  I&#8217;ll be happy to leave an update when I crack the case.</p>


	<h2>Recommended Ports</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Firefox (www/firefox)</li>
		<li>OpenOffice.Org v.2 (editors/openoffice-2.0)
 Gnome (x11-wm/gnome2)
(although gnome2-lite looks interesting&#8230;)</li>
		<li>lighttpd (www/lighttpd)</li>
		<li>Ruby (devel/ruby18)</li>
		<li>Subversion (devel/subversion)</li>
		<li>tsclient (net/tsclient) This program handles <span class="caps">RDP</span> connections to Windows machines and <span class="caps">VNC</span> connections to others.  Beats both gdesktop and kdesktop.</li>
		<li>Trac (www/trac)</li>
		<li>Gimp (graphics/gimp)</li>
		<li>Gaim (net-im/gaim)</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>


	<p>The Java ports.  FreeBSD&#8217;s support for Java might seem intimidating, but it&#8217;s not so bad, as long as you can live with 1.4.  You can still run Eclipse, and a lot of Java programs on the 1.4 <span class="caps">JDK</span>.</p>

<time datetime="2005-12-12T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 12<span>th</span>, 2005</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Before We Get Started</h3>


	<p>First, the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">documentation for FreeBSD</a> is absolutely fabulous.  If you are Googling something about FreeBSD, your heart will sing when one of the links is from the handbook, because the answer will soon be in your grasp.</p>


	<p>Second, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/ct/15">Dru Lavigne&#8217;s FreeBSD series</a> is another fantastic resources.  I highly recommend reading those articles, as they&#8217;ve been very informative during my adoption process.</p>


	<p>Third, I decided to track FreeBSD-STABLE based on the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html">criteria for choosing between <span class="caps">STABLE</span> and <span class="caps">CURRENT</span></a>.  You don&#8217;t have to do either&#8212;you can simply install from binaries.  But this is a learning exercize for me, and I think it would be a great learning experience to be able to contribute to FreeBSD somehow.  That&#8217;s much more likely from <span class="caps">STABLE</span> at least.</p>


	<h3>Step 1: Obtaining the Install CDs</h3>


	<p>FreeBSD 6.0 is the latest release of FreeBSD.  Download both <span class="caps">ISO</span> files, as you&#8217;ll need at least one port off the second CD.  FreeBSD offers <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/6.0R/announce.html">several methods</a> for acquiring the CD&#8217;s or <span class="caps">ISO</span> images.  Assuming that you <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/11/15/getting-started">have space on your hard drive available</a> you can stick the CD in your drive and get going.</p>


	<h3>Step 2:  Beginning the Installation</h3>


	<p>Don&#8217;t blink an eye during the boot process.  Note that the <strong><span class="caps">F12</span></strong> key is the one to go for during the now lightning-fast <span class="caps">BIOS</span>/POST process on Dell machines.  It will give the the option to boot once from the CD, or to go to the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> menu to permanently move the CD option above the HD for booting purposes.</p>


	<p>When the FreeBSD installer loads, don&#8217;t blink here either.  It&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;ll need to choose <strong>option 7</strong> to boot with <span class="caps">USB</span> keyboard support.  From there, you should get into the installation itself.</p>


	<h3>Step 3:  Preparing a minimal install.</h3>


	<p>Go through the installation procedure.  You won&#8217;t need a walkthrough for every step, but here are some tips.  If you are going to want any Java elements on your system, enable Linux binary compatability when asked.  I recommend not configuring inetd, but enabling ssh.  Don&#8217;t look to me for advice on your bootloader, but FreeBSD&#8217;s is the bare minimum and don&#8217;t count on its flexibility.</p>


	<p>When installing, you only want to choose one port: <strong>cvsup-without-gui</strong>  One of the strengths of FreeBSD is the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">ports collection</a> which is the FreeBSD analog to package administration, if you&#8217;re familiar with Linux system administration.  The ports system works in a fundamentally different way than package management, however.  We&#8217;ll cover that here in time, but Dru&#8217;s resources contain quite a bit of information about the ports system to get you started.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ll be using <span class="caps">CVSUP</span> to track FreeBSD&#8217;s <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository for ports and kernel code, as well.  Since we&#8217;ll be getting these crucial elements shortly, and they are easy to retrieve form the command line (provided you have a very basic grasp of vi&#8212;which I personally loathe), so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going with a minimum install.</p>


	<h3>Step 4: <span class="caps">CVSUP</span></h3>


	<p><span class="caps">CVSUP</span> is a special <span class="caps">CVS</span> bound to the FreeBSD source repositories.  I set up the binding for my machine by copying <code>/usr/share/examples/cvsup/stable-supfile</code> to <code>/root/supfile</code>.  I used vi to assign a hostname and to indicate that in addition to <code>src-all</code> (which downloads the kernel source) I would also like <code>ports-all tag=.</code>.  (Ports are tagged differently than kernel source&#8212;you can read more in the comments.)</p>


	<p>After that, <code>cvsup -L 2 /root/supfile</code> kicks off the download process.  When that&#8217;s complete, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to configure a kernel, and/or get started installing any number of programs.  Hooray!</p>


	<h3>What&#8217;s Next:</h3>


	<p>I choose to set up some userland programs so I can start using my machine again after a long downtime period.</p>
