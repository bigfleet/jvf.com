  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friday was the first &#8220;real day&#8221; of the conference, with <span class="caps">DHH</span>&#8217;s opening keynote (well summarized by Patrick Reagan <a href="http://blog.viget.com/tech/2007/05/20/whats-coming-in-rails-20/">here</a>) and the first day of sessions.  You&#8217;ll have to wait for my own summary post on the entire conference to get my impressions of the keynote speakers.</p>

	<p>After that, Jon, Patrick and I had a horrible dinner at American Cowgirls which I will now erase from my memory forever.  After that, we walked to some bar whose name I can&#8217;t remember where I fell asleep in a chair on the back patio.  We took a cab back to the hotel, and I relished my good fortune.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve never been to a talk by Bob Martin before, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/503608084/in/set-72157600225783815/">one picture really does equal a thousand words</a>. (Make sure to check out the link in the third comment.) He is a very passionate, very intense speaker.  He challenges the listener to rise to a higher level of code-fu.    This was the first time I had heard him talk, and I won&#8217;t be likely to forget it anytime soon.</p>


	<p>More than any of the lessons about Ruby that we went through, what stuck with me the most was the attitude he shared with his listeners about rewriting and redesigning the system you&#8217;re working with.  In his view, the &#8220;main build&#8221; never ceases forward motion.  Requirements will be added and the code base will change in response.  Thus, any redesign is still aiming at a moving target.  His warning was to be very careful about pinning all your hopes as a developer on the Once and Future Rewrite.</p>


	<p>He would recommend that when you work with a certain piece of code, check it back in a little cleaner, and a little nicer.  Eventually, those habits will accrete and really start to add up in terms of code quality.</p>


	<p>You can get a lot of the benefits of this talk (without Bob&#8217;s inimitable style) by reading <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/presentations/rails2007/martin_robert.pdf">his presentation files</a>.  Those files use Java as the language, but feel free to skip those bits to get the flavor of his message.  It&#8217;s definitely worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ben Scofield, who I had not met, works with Patrick Reagan, who I have.  Combined with the fact that almost every Rails site that I have written has some amount of static content, I was interested to see the talk.</p>


	<p>In the style of Bob Martin&#8217;s talk early in the day, Ben&#8217;s presentation dealt with a progression of potential solutions to the problem of handling static material within Rails.  The first solutions were very greasy!  Check out this potential security hole:</p>


<code>
<pre>
def show
  page_path = params[:path].join('/')
  if File.exists?("#{RAILS_ROOT}/app/views/static/#{page_path}.rhtml")
    render :template =&gt; "static/#{page_path}"
  end
end
</pre>
</code>

	<p>Obviously, that was from phase one.  In the end, they end up with a solution of some elegance!</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t want to short-change Ben here, but I would like to give a better writeup when he comes to speak at <a href="http://www.cvreg.org/"><span class="caps">CVREG</span></a> in the coming months.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> has a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/JRuby">JRuby talk</a> that really doesn&#8217;t share that much with the talk that they gave during the tutorial session at RailsConf, and that does the presenters a disservice.  Even though they were not the most engaging speakers on the bill for the weekend, they had great slides and a great plan to present their material effectively.  As Glenn Vanderburg says <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/railsconf07_highlights.rdoc">Boring is <strong>great</strong> for JRuby</a> Unfortunately, it is still hard when someone audibly falls asleep twice during your presentation.</p>


	<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know about JRuby, please click on a few of the links from this post to inform yourself.  I don&#8217;t have very much to add besides my impression that JRuby is already a very big deal and they announced that they will go 1.0 within a month.  That seems impressive to me with the outstanding bug list, but, of course, we&#8217;ll see.  As exciting as Ruby is, it&#8217;s important that the entire community remembers that not only is our favorite language still very young on the scene.  By any factor that you&#8217;d care to conjure (developers who know the language, book sales, installed base, project count, etc.), Ruby is still much smaller than Java.  By building the bridge so that these two great languages can live together on the <span class="caps">JVM</span> (an amazing technology itself), both languages will be far the better for it.</p>


	<p>I will update this post if the slides become available and their availability attracts my attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Put on by <a href="http://codefluency.com/">Bruce Williams</a> and an uncredited <a href="http://vernix.org/marcel/">Marcel Molina, Jr.</a>, this session proved to be one of the highlights of the conference for me personally.  My experience up to this point has led to a lot of time spent with <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> education&#8212;thus I spend a lot of time working with those two technologies.  As a result, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of view code, and produce a lot of the code smells that they covered in the talk.</p>


	<p>I want to specifically give voice on my own forum to echo one of their own observations.  So much focus has been given in the Rails community toward getting the right balance of responsibility between the model and the controller.  Between them, the model and the data just make data available to the controller.  That&#8217;s a <strong>lot</strong> of work to do in the view, to create the sort of dynamic interfaces that end users expect us in this day and age.  <span class="caps">HTML</span>, JavaScript, and <span class="caps">CSS</span> are complicated enough that there are many professionals who operate only on that level.  At least to this point, the view has not gotten the same sort of attention that the other levels have gotten from the developer community, even though it&#8217;s very important and difficult to get view code written cleanly and correctly.  The two speakers then gave a dynamic walkthrough of several problems that manifest in view code, along with examples of &#8220;smelly&#8221; and &#8220;fixed&#8221; code.  In the session, they went into greater depth for some of the examples.</p>


	<p>If you deal with Rails views at all, I recommend as strongly as possible that you <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/presentations/rails2007/VisForVexing.pdf">download the slides</a> and read through their presentation.  You won&#8217;t have a chance to ask them questions directly, but I&#8217;m quite sure that the two of them would be happy to engage with a reader.</p>


	<p>One particular technique that received quite a bit of attention, and which I plan on following up on as soon as I can is the block helper.  It was used twice for the smells that I put out quite frequently, as well as getting some discussion as an alternative for partials.  Seeing how I use partials in my own code, this is a very big deal.  Anticipate more posts from me on this topic in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got into Portland with relatively little trouble, although I had actually booked a stay at my Wednesday hotel for the wrong night because I am a brainiac.  I got on the road in relatively short order the following morning, even though I ended up getting very little sleep.  Also, since I was changing hotels, I got to hoss my luggage with me around.</p>


	<p>Although I was tempted, I did not actually catch up on any sleep during the first tutorial session, which was <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/2007/5/24/railsconf-writeups-your-first-day-with-jruby-on-rails">Your First Day on JRuby on Rails</a></p>


	<p>My travel schedule ended up squeezing out meals because I spent what would have been my layover at <span class="caps">JFK</span> on the tarmac instead, because of rain.  As a result, I was hungry as I get on Thursday afternoon, and you can easily verify from people who actually know me what that means.  Let&#8217;s just say that eating was a top priority.  I walked over to <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=32">McMenamin&#8217;s</a> which had the best food I had in Portland, but I paid dearly for it the rest of the weekend.  My feet ended up hurting very badly for the rest of the weekend.  And, yes, I was still carrying my luggage around.</p>


	<p>I got back for my afternoon session, the awesome <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/2007/5/24/railsconf-writeups-when-v-is-for-vexing">When V is for Vexing: Patterns to <span class="caps">DRY</span> up Your Views</a>.</p>


	<p>I had gotten together with <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/">Jon Maddox</a>, my gracious host for the weekend, and confirmed where he was staying.  That meant I got to drop off my bags finally.  I then set a course for the Joyent Happy Hour.  When I got there, it looked like <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/17075059@N00/504156094/">this</a>.  I was shocked, because I started <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=15643">this thread</a> on the normally chatty TextDrive forum and got zippo response before hand.  I ended up finding one of the last beers, but it wasn&#8217;t cold.  So I constantly had the beer in my hand, trying to cool it down in an ice bucket while everyone was asking me if I knew where to find more beer.  I didn&#8217;t, and there were some real mega-watt folks that I embarrased myself in front of as a result of holding one of the last beers at the first day&#8217;s happy hour.</p>


	<p>Apart from that, I had a ridiculously good time, as I talked to David for more than just a minute as he gave me a T-shirt.  I also ran into the two Joyent Scotts&#8212;<a href="http://www.scottpburton.com/">Scott Burton</a> (nice website!) and <a href="http://rubyi.st/">Scott Barron</a>.  Presumably they picked those names just to confuse us.  It was a great meeting, though, because Scott Burton was able to get my straightened right out with the problem that I ran into that ended my first work session on <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/GettingThingsSlung">Getting Things Slung</a> as I detailed <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/2007/5/18/getting-started-with-getting-things-slung">on my blog</a></p>


	<p>I called Megan on my way back to the hotel, where I hooked up with Jon.  We then headed down into the city to grab dinner and some brews.  The brew was excellent, the food less so.  Especially not cool was the creepiest old lady that I have ever seen telling me that I smelled like shampoo and conditioner.  At least, I know she said shampoo and conditioner, and also referenced me.  Our waitress chased her away, but then she came right back to me!  What did <strong>I</strong> do?  I&#8217;ll mention Portland more during the complete wrap-up at the end of my RailsConf Writeup series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t started reading his books because of his death, but I read <em>Cat&#8217;s Cradle</em> during my sister&#8217;s graduation.  I fell in love all over again with his content and his style.  I hadn&#8217;t read any of his work since I was in middle school (Harrison Bergeron, with the predictable effects).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve read the first few pages of <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>, and I am quite certain that he will become one of my favorite authors.  At the same time, it becomes clear to me that I should begin some library transfer from my father.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Insipired by a chance to win <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki">one year of a large accelerator</a>, I started <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/GettingThingsSlung">Getting Things Slung</a>.  I am working on a Java application that is designed to sync contacts from MS Outlook, so I&#8217;m somewhat interested in the off-line/on-line client space.  Also, the prize is pretty enticing, and the screenshot sure was pretty!  So that&#8217;s all it took for me to decide to spend the plane ride over working on getting an entry ready.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m doing a Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> version, and I really have no interest in the Windows side of things.</p>


	<h2>Briefing</h2>


	<p>The pair of Joyent web pages have generally good information.  I&#8217;m intending this blog post to supplement that material.  Also, even though at one point I was using it all the time, there&#8217;s now nothing I hate worse than Trac markup syntax, so I&#8217;m not going to use it.</p>


	<p>I also recommend reading this through once before you go through it and try to follow it.</p>


	<h2>Basecamp (not that one)</h2>


	<p>We&#8217;re trying to simulate a server-side and client-side sync process.  There&#8217;s no reason that we can&#8217;t set that up on the same computer.  Ultimately, in addition, we&#8217;ll want the trunk directory in the Slingshot.app file to be the <strong>same</strong> as the server-side code.</p>


	<h3>Set up Subversion</h3>


	<p>I set up a Subversion repository on my own machine just for these purposes.  I checked in the most recent release of <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a> into my repository, then checked it out to a working directory in my typical Rails workspace, and also checked it in from within the .app file.  (You can cd into them using the terminal&#8212;go ahead!)</p>


	<h3>Getting TextMate open</h3>


	<p>You&#8217;ll end up with <span class="caps">TWO</span> TextMate windows open.  One is for the client-side, and that will have extra directories in it.  The other is for the server-side.</p>


	<h3>Getting Terminals in position</h3>


	<p>You&#8217;ll need terminal windows open to have a window to start mongrel_rails (for the server side) and for running <code>svn up</code> inside the Slingshot VM.</p>


	<h2>Head Above Water</h2>


	<p>The first place to go after getting yourself in position is to work on getting the client side in position to do the first downward sync.  The <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/BasicApp">wiki docs</a> can walk you through that.  For me, the process involved editing the <code>start.sh</code>, <code>sync_up.sh</code>, and <code>sync_down.sh</code>, while making sure that Tracks itself was running and passing tests.  Let&#8217;s just say that some parts of the code are a little brittle.</p>


	<p>As an example, the operative line from the <code>sync_up.sh</code> file looked like this for me:</p>


<pre>
<code>
ruby ../bin/rake joyent_slingshot:sync_up SYNC_CONTROLLER=http://localhost:4000/sync/up
</code>
</pre>

	<h2> Monday Night <span class="caps">RAW</span> on your adopted application.</h2>


	<p>I had to write migrations and fix not-exactly-bugs in Tracks to get it ready to run in the Slingshot environment.  This will happen to you if you didn&#8217;t write the code, so get ready to &#8220;stand on the shoulders of giants&#8221; as Adam Keys might say.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;ll also have to follow the instructions for the <a href="http://developers.joyent.com/wiki/SlingshotPlugin">Slingshot plugin</a> which, by virtue of being installed on the server-side, is <span class="caps">ALSO</span> installed on the client side, because you set them to be to same with Subversion.  <strong><span class="caps">RIGHT</span>?</strong></p>


	<p>The existing examples include&#8230; let&#8217;s call it a non-granular approach to preparing the set of information to be synchronized.  This is OK for now, go ahead and do that.  We&#8217;ll make things a little better before it&#8217;s all over.</p>


	<h2>Check <span class="caps">XML</span> from the server</h2>


	<p>I had a problem with having the <strong>first</strong> request to my server-side sync action completing successfully.  After catching (by accident) the Joyent Scotts out on the balcony, Scott Burton told me that he had <strong>the same problem</strong> and it had to do with a different version of Rails running in <code>vendor/rails</code> than I had mentioned in <code>config/environment.rb</code> so watch for that.  That brought my first work session to a halt.</p>


	<p>Don&#8217;t stop until you&#8217;re pulling <span class="caps">XML</span> down.  You&#8217;re more than half way done at this point.</p>


	<p>You know, this is enough for one post.</p>
