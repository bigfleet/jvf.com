  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with <a href="/2008/3/22/the-boring-one-about-my-leg">my health problems with my leg</a>, this may come as a surprise.</p>


	<p>I had surgery a week ago, on Wednesday morning.  You can see a description of <a href="http://totalspine.com/Minimally-Invasive-Surgery/Lumbar-Micro-Endo.asp">lumbar micro-discectomy</a> at my doctors&#8217; site.</p>


	<p>I was nervous leading up to the incident, especially after finding out that I would be intubated, but that&#8217;s in the rear view mirror now.  After they put the IV in, I remember a few more discussions and then them leaving me in a hall for a second.  Next thing I remember was waking up after the procedure in the recovery room and asking for some water.</p>


	<p>In terms of the pain that has been a part of my life for so long, that particular kind of pain is gone.  I am healing from surgery, and that&#8217;s never going to be a ride at Carowinds, but there&#8217;s no comparison between them.  I am so fortunate to come across excellent doctors and <a href="http://www.presbyterian.org/">an exceptional hospital in Charlotte</a></p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way from that pretty helpless first 24 hours after the surgery, but there&#8217;s still always to go on the recovery process.  I did have enough strength to run some errands yesterday afternoon, but
I am on a very strict schedule for how long I can sit up straight.  I even have what&#8217;s basically a perfect assistant there, having picked up <a href="http://www.embraceware.com/software/awaken/">Awaken</a> during one of the last Mac software blowouts.  I also have to wear these ridiculous tights for some kind of circulation issue in my legs.  Don&#8217;t expect pictures.</p>


	<p>My mother has been in town helping the recovery process, and she leaves in a few hours.  I know both Megan and I have found her presence invaluable.  It will be hard to say goodbye this time.</p>


	<p>To sum up, I am still not fully independent (try keeping track of how often you bend at the waist today) but I am sure that day will come soon.  That will be welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Mail</h2>


	<p>I have a good GMail system that I love.  I used it to sort through approximately 5,000 e-mails from over two years into a pile of less than 30.  Two wrenches are in those gears right now.  All my workstation time is on Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> now (yes!) and the new FireFox 3 betas are already the best browser there, in my opinion.  But <strong>curses</strong>! my Better GMail extension is not yet available!  Second wrench&#8212;I have to learn to get back to my starred messages (a.k.a. action items).  Take it to the next level.</p>


	<h2>Church</h2>


	<p>I joined a church, the <a href="http://www.uuccharlotte.org/"><span class="caps">UUCC</span></a>.  I think we&#8217;ll have more on that as it develops, but it&#8217;s one of the elements in our Charlotte life that Megan and I have already come to value very deeply.</p>


	<h2>Music</h2>


	<p>Megan made fun of me for calling a recent playlist &#8220;a mix tape,&#8221; because clearly it&#8217;s not getting anywhere near a cassette player.  We don&#8217;t even <strong>own</strong> a cassette player (although I still have a few of my <a href="http://www.ktru.org/"><span class="caps">KTRU</span></a> shows on tape&#8212;the dream lives on!).</p>


	<p>I simultaneously acknowledge that she is right, and rue the woeful downgrade in the coolness of sharing personal music.  A &#8220;playlist&#8221;?  Really?  A &#8220;mix&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even sound any better!  Do I have to send people the <span class="caps">MP3</span>&#8217;s or do I make a real CD?  Are they going to download these tracks?  Yuck.  Much less cool.</p>


	<p>Also, was having a Walkman ever cool?  I mean, people working out had them, and that was obviously cool.  But what about everyone else?</p>


	<h2>Music</h2>


	<p>On an related note, it blows my mind that having an iTunes library comprised largely of a network file share is such a problem.  I don&#8217;t want to keep 160GB of music on my hard drive.  <strong><span class="caps">HELLO</span>!</strong></p>


	<h2>Music, one more time (hit me!)</h2>


	<p>We didn&#8217;t go to a concert in Charleston, SC on Saturday night because <a href="/2008/3/22/the-boring-one-about-my-leg">my leg hurt so badly.</a>  We ended up having a low-key weekend with plenty of relaxation thrown in, as well as a haircut.</p>


	<h2>Money</h2>


	<p>Megan and I are also having budget talks.  It takes a long time to go from &#8220;we have no real way of tracking or planning for expenditures&#8221; to &#8220;we know what expenses we incur each month, and are planning to spend in ways that more closely match our values in the future.&#8221;  We are getting very close, but it&#8217;s been a journey filled of discoveries and new understandings.  I highly recommend it to everyone.</p>

Yes, a tinge. But it didn&#8217;t strike me as that daring, either. Isn&#8217;t New York as safe now as it was in 1963? It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re living in downtown Baghdad. <p> Anyway, for weeks my boy had been begging for me to please leave him somewhere, anywhere, and let him try to figure out how to get home on his own. So on that sunny Sunday I gave him a subway map, a MetroCard, a $20 bill, and several quarters, just in case he had to make a call. <p> No, I did not give him a cell phone. Didn&#8217;t want to lose it. And no, I didn&#8217;t trail him, like a mommy private eye. I trusted him to figure out that he should take the Lexington Avenue subway down, and the 34th Street crosstown bus home. If he couldn&#8217;t do that, I trusted him to ask a stranger. And then I even trusted that stranger not to think, &#8216;Gee, I was about to catch my train home, but now I think I&#8217;ll abduct this adorable child instead.&#8217; <p> Long story short: My son got home, ecstatic with independence. <p> Long story longer, and analyzed, to boot: Half the people I&#8217;ve told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse. As if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s debilitating&#8212;for us and for them. </blockquote> <br clear="ALL">&#8220;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who don&#8217;t know anything about my problems with my leg (and back), it&#8217;s been causing me a great deal of pain in the last year.  When the pain began in April or May of 2007, it wasn&#8217;t bad at first.  Nothing really <strong>happened</strong> to make it start hurting, I just noticed that it did one day.  It wouldn&#8217;t bother me all the time, just every once in awhile.  I thought &#8220;if it&#8217;s still bothering me like this in June, I&#8217;ll go to the doctor.&#8221;</p>


	<p>It was still bothering me at the end of June, I went to the walk-in clinic, and they gave me some muscle relaxers and told me to keep taking Aleve.  That helped for a couple weeks, but didn&#8217;t stop the pain.  I figured the next stage there was getting a referral, and I wasn&#8217;t sure it was that serious.  I went to a chiropractor, and he seemed like a quack.  He had signed pictures of him with Whitesnake and Frank Stallone.  Didn&#8217;t seem like the right atmosphere to me.</p>


	<p>After that, Megan and I took our Europe trip.  I made it through without too much trouble and had a great time.  I did have to miss one evening in Nimes, but overall I don&#8217;t remember it causing me that much trouble on the trip.  Three days after we got back, my former employer laid off pretty much everyone without equity in the company.  It was totally unexpected.  I suddenly had to think of my leg being ruled a pre-existing condition at any job I&#8217;d ever have in the future, in addition to the stress of traveling the country to find a new job with <strong>my wedding</strong> and my ten year high school reunion in the weeks to come.</p>


	<p>I found <a href="/2007/12/20/a-launch">a great job</a> with relative quickness, but the insurance was scheduled to start 30 days after the first day of my first full month of employment.  November.  As it turned out, there was some administrative difficulty getting my plan in order, since I was working in North Carolina and living in Virginia.  By the time I had proof of insurance (not presenting as self-pay), it was mid-November from then, the first referral appointment was late November.</p>


	<p>At that time, I went to the doctor and got a referral to a physical therapist.  I did feel some improvement after some of the sessions, but not all of them.  I went to four sessions before heading to Des Moines to spend the Christmas holiday with my parents.  Because of weather and the precarious nature of travel, Megan and I ended up driving a couple hours to Raleigh to make a flight to make up for the one that got cancelled from Richmond.  That just kicked off a comedy of errors for Northwest, who I honestly intend never to fly with again.  (I hear people say that for effect, when an agent tries to get them to gate check their bag, but I mean it.)  A few days later, one evening I was laying on my back, on the floor, in the worst physical pain that I&#8217;ve ever experienced.  For those of you who do not know what nerve pain is live, I hope that you never experience it.  I went to a doctor in Des Moines the next morning and was prescribed a steroid series, which helped until I got back to Richmond.</p>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t book any more visits with the physical therapist.  Our plans called for a move to Charlotte early in 2008, and I suspected that I would find some treatment there.  I am seeing <a href="http://www.posturecheck.com/">a chiropractor in Charlotte</a> and that has relieved the pain considerably, but it&#8217;s still a long journey to being pain-free.  I&#8217;m told there are no guarantees.  It bothered me a little more than normal this week, but I&#8217;m hoping to be able to help out around the house tomorrow.  Sometimes I can&#8217;t, even when I would like to.  Lame.  Literally!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://www.builttospill.com/">Built To Spill</a> at the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodtheatre.com/">Neighborhood Theater</a> here in Charlotte earlier this month.  I almost didn&#8217;t go because I felt a little low energy, but I couldn&#8217;t be happier that I did.  It was an excellent introduction to live music here in Charlotte.  They closed their set with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Built+to+Spill/_/Carry+the+Zero">Carry The Zero</a>, a song that I named one of my favorite mix CD&#8217;s after&#8212;ten years ago!  Unreal.</p>


	<p>Also interesting was the discovery that rock and roll is still alive&#8212;and it looks like my dad!  I can&#8217;t find any pictures of what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Martsch">Doug Martsch</a> is looking like these days, but he&#8217;s not going to be on <span class="caps">TRL</span> anytime soon.  I bought a cigarette off a beggar for 75 cents.  I&#8217;m not sure whether to feel depressed or whether I was actually showing him the way up and out of poverty.</p>


	<p>Last night, Megan and I went to see <a href="http://www.gregbrown.org/">Greg Brown</a> at the <a href="http://www.charlottecultureguide.com/organization.php?id=78">McGlohon Theater</a>.  An <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=609730463">old friend</a> got me into Greg Brown <strong>more</strong> than ten years ago. I saw him in Knoxville&#8217;s Laurel Theater ages ago.  This show was a lot more bluesy, but he was still personable and so relaxed.  He broke a string, and retuned the guitar and finished the song with more aplomb than some other musicians do a whole solo.</p>


	<p>I was amazed at how intimate the venue was.  Incredible.  Megan got very distracted at some of our fellow concertgoers&#8212;you must learn to tune them out, grasshopper!  We took the light rail into uptown to try that out.  It will be worth it for ballgames, but overall I thought the most impressive part of the light rail was getting a fuller view of Charlotte itself.  There is definitely a lot to like about this city.  I&#8217;m feeling very at home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I write this, with the late evening games of Round 1 yet to conclude, I stand tied for first in <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/group?entryIDFrom=2430688&#38;groupID=16115">my bracket competition</a>.  Come on, buckets, I could use the spare dough!  I am officially worried by the Clemson Tigers at this second, however.  A Tiger beats a Wildcat every time, though, so I am sure they&#8217;ll pull through.  I don&#8217;t care how feisty that Wildcat is.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m happy to see the UT men&#8217;s basketball team put together a good season, and I thought the game against Memphis was a classic.  I hope to see them do well, even though I picked them to get upset early.  That way I at least get something to be happy about either way.</p>


	<p>The <a href="http://fans.pbwiki.com/">Fans of the <span class="caps">ACC</span></a> 2008 season is about to get underway.  It seems that there&#8217;s always something rocky during the off-season, and I&#8217;m considering having this be my last year as commissioner so that I can just enjoy playing for a change, but who knows.</p>


	<p>I like the way my team looks&#8212;but I did last year as well and finished 8th out of ten!  I drafted horribly and made some terrible trades.  I tried to learn from my mistakes and put together a better off-season this time.  You can check out <a href="http://fansoftheacc.baseball.sportsline.com/teams/page/1">my team</a> if you like.</p>


	<p>I may not have football, but it&#8217;s a good looking spring right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to introduce you to <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/tree/master">Blanket</a>, a library designed to make automated, remote backup easier.  I&#8217;ve had to set up automated backup before, and I wrote this package to make it more enjoyable for myself and others.  I was also experimenting with a lot of new technologies and techniques, which makes it even more rewarding that the end product ending being a preliminary success.</p>


	<p>An <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/quickstart">introduction to Blanket</a> is available at the excellent <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/blanket/">blanket project on RubyForge</a> which means that I also have my first Gem in the wild.</p>


	<p>Install it, kick it around, and if you like what you see, take a look at <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/todo">the development road map</a> and see if you&#8217;d like to get involved.  I have some GitHub invites if you need them, so please contact me if that&#8217;s an issue.</p>
