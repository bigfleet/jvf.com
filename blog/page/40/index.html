  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is Spring all about?</h2>

<p>Spring is commonly described as an Inversion of Control (IOC) or dependency injection container.  While I understand what the terms mean, I have the <del>- what would Dave Thomas call it? -</del> novice reaction of.. &#8220;So?&#8221;</p>

<p>To say Spring does only one thing would be a great injustice.  But I have to start in one place, and that&#8217;s getting <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and Spring tied together.  To do this, a perusal of the documentation and the sample application makes it clear that I&#8217;m going to need to work with an <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span>. <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span> is a subclass of <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span>, and here&#8217;s what the Spring reference manual says that a <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> does:</p>

<blockquote>
The <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility.
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of questions I had before my evaluation that were based on this claim, and how Spring ended up.</p>

<dl>
<dt><p>Q. Can it give me access to many different Hibernate <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> objects at runtime?   Because heaven forbid my bosses would sell an entirely separate version of the application to a client&#8230;</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. Absolutely.  This actually couldn&#8217;t be easier.</p></dd>
<dt><p>Q. What about alternate configurations of the same <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span>?  For example, I need my <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> pointing at a different database in a production environment than where it points during a developmental one.</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. Yes, this is possible.  It&#8217;s equally as involved as the techniques I&#8217;m using with <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> do perform this same task right now, you just have to put the output into a new file.  For my own personal implementation, it will actually reduce the number of files I&#8217;m having to manage, but I need to do some subtle things with my Spring configuration files first.</p></dd>
<dt><p>Q. What about my actual beans?  Certianly my <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> is a bean.  What about my <span class="caps">POJO</span>&#8217;s?  Do I have to re-do my Hibernate mappings in Spring format?  The sample application would seem to indicate that I do not, but is that just because it&#8217;s a lightweight sample?</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. You can use Spring to configure whatever it is that you want.  You probably shouldn&#8217;t redo your Hibernate mapping files inside, but if you want some pre-fab instantiations of some Hibernate objects, Spring would be the way to go.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2>OK, So What&#8217;s A Bean?</h2>

<h4>From the reference:</h4>

<blockquote>
The <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> isn&#8217;t limited to just managing beans, it is also able to manage virtually any class you want it to manage. [&#8230;] (I)t&#8217;s possible to have more exotic non-bean-style classes in your BeanFactory.
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, clear your mind of what &#8220;bean&#8221; means in whatever context you are familiar with.  &#8220;Bean&#8221; means any Java class, really.  If you&#8217;re clever enough, you can use Spring to set up nearly any object you&#8217;re interested in.  Bean definitions require an implementation class, which is natural enough.  One more reason to <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000008.html">program to interfaces</a> if you plan on using Spring.  Then, you can let it do the dirty work of carrying the right implementation to your classes!</p>

<p>You can describe the methods that need to be called on initialization and destruction of a bean, which is very nice.  I can think of a few contexts where that might be useful.</p>

<p>Spring beans can depend on other Spring beans, a concept that will be illustrated in the next Spring post, where you see how to get your hands dirty.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>At this point in my evaluation process, Spring does two things.  First, it configures <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> objects very nicely.  I don&#8217;t have to write any ThreadLocal classes, or re-write the same code over and over when I want to use the same code with different input in different contexts (e.g. inside the container, outside the container, local database, remote database).  Second, it will manage the <span class="inlineCode">Session</span> objects so I don&#8217;t have to.  I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye out to make sure that this is actually working in a way I understand;  as a developer, try not to rely on technologies you don&#8217;t understand on some level.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, make it four!  I get transaction management and second level caching <strong>for free</strong>.  I&#8217;m not kidding.  Setting up Hibernate&#8217;s transaction manager is an extra three lines of <span class="caps">XML</span>, and setting up the cache means copying a <span class="caps">JAR</span> file.  Spring actually complained when I left out the <span class="caps">JAR</span> that enabled the caching ability.</p>

<p>These two&#8212;er, four&#8212; areas make a big win for me.  Also, now I&#8217;m in a boat with other people who will be working on the finer points for me, so I can focus on <strong>getting my work done</strong>.  Using open source products puts you on a team, for better or worse.  I love teams, so for me, it&#8217;s better.  Spring does many other things, as well, so they&#8217;re ready when I am.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m still wondering how on Earth Spring is going to handle <span class="inlineCode">Session</span> management without knowing about <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/salmon"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a>!  The <span class="inlineCode">WebApplicationContext</span> seems like where that magic might happen.  Spring is set up and working, however, after about three days of looking at it and working on it off and on.  If I do need to understand more about <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span>s to get exactly the behavior I&#8217;m looking for, that&#8217;s quite all right with me.  I&#8217;ll share whatever I learn here!</p>

<p>Maybe I was too hard on <span class="caps">DAO</span> <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000011.html">here</a>.  The <span class="inlineCode">HibernateClinic</span> class which extends Spring&#8217;s <span class="inlineCode">HibernateDaoSupport</span> looks exactly like a class I&#8217;ve already written to provide many of the same features.  If I had <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000008.html">written to an interface</a> in the first place, it would be trivial to plug in Spring behind the scenes&#8230; for that class, anyway!</p>

<p>A question for the future, since no one actually reads this yet.</p>

<p>Inside the sample petclinic <span class="inlineCode">HibernateClinic</span> class, this is about as complex as the code gets:</p>

<pre class="code">
public List findOwners(String lastName) throws DataAccessException {
    return getHibernateTemplate().find("from Owner owner where owner.lastName like ?", lastName + "%");
}
</pre>

<p>What about something more complicated?  Do your most complicated queries belong in the <span class="caps">DAO</span> class/usage pattern?  <span class="caps">DAO</span> seems to only slightly modify <span class="caps">CRUD</span>.  Where&#8217;s the beef?  For now, my persistence service is going to extend <span class="inlineCode">HibernateDaoSupport</span>, but will include all the complicated queries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What Are Mock Objects?</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Mock Objects are a stand-in for the real world</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mock Objects make a difference in the web applications, because the objects you&#8217;re writing depend on objects like <span class="inlineCode">ServletRequest</span> and <span class="inlineCode">ServletResponse</span>.  And how do you get them to do something you want?</p></dd>
<dt>Controllable without fuss</dt>
<dd><p>Mock objects implement interfaces like the above, giving you a chance to write up different implementations for different, testable behavior.</p></dd>
<dt>Simulate things that would otherwise be impossible</dt>
<dd><p>What if you need to test the performance of your system when the database goes down, or the network is unreachable?  Depending on your code, those things may actually be impossible to test otherwise, but Mock Objects can make it possible.</p></dd>
<dt>Mock Objects are just like film stand-ins</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper than the leading man</li>
<li>Less temperamental</li>
<li>Always available</li>
<li>Good enough for setting up the production environment <i>rimshot</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>How To Use Mock Objects</h2>

<p>
In a lot of cases, using Mock Objects seems easy enough.  There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.mockobjects.org">Mock Objects</a> framework already written with many useful implementations already.  There are <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/wiki/DynaMock">other</a> <a href="http://www.easymock.org/index.html">frameworks</a> designed to make it easier.
</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s really not the whole story.</p>

<h4>About Your Mock Objects</h4>

<p>
One very useful thing to remember is that, unlike a movie stand-in, your Mock Object should provide <strong>more</strong> functionality than the object it&#8217;s standing in for.  If your Mock Object is implementing an interface or extending another class, it&#8217;ll likely need to keep extra state and provide extra methods to provide the means by which you can influence precisely what the Mock implementation will be doing.
</p>

<h4>Making It Happen</h4>
<p>
The most difficult part of the entire process is getting your &#8220;real&#8221; code to use the mock objects during testing, while they use the real objects during production&#8212;or even other levels of testing.  This is where you, as a developer, have to earn your pay.
</p>
<h4>An example</h4>
<p>
What I really wanted to involve in unit testing was my <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000031.html"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a> controllers.  I can test my persistence layer with <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DbUnit</a> and my domain model with <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.  Those web controllers were the last mile of feeling that I could use full automated testing on my projects.
</p>
<p>
So, the controller doesn&#8217;t implement an interface, and it already extends another class.  The solution for me was to create an abstract class with two concrete subclasses.  One subclass is the real one, referenced in the <span class="caps">JSP</span> page.  The other is the &#8220;mock&#8221; one used for testing.  All the important behavior is located in the abstract superclass.  Since the controllers extend a class with a default constructor, all that needs to be done is some field initialization within the constructor for the mock controller.  That got me almost all the way there.
</p>
<p>There was one last snag.  Some elements of the <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> framework, like <span class="inlineCode">HtmlSubmitButton</span> and <span class="inlineCode">HtmlText</span> call methods that need the <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> system.properties file.  This solution was just as simple.  Use another mock!</p>
<p>I created simple mock subclasses of those concrete classes that override the methods that need initialization of the properties subsystem.  During constructor initialization, instead of assigning a new instance of <span class="inlineCode">HtmlText</span> to the field, I assign a new instance of <span class="inlineCode">MockHtmlText</span> instead.  </p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not done with my testing implementations yet;  I have to get my datastores into the action.  But this is an excellent example of how Mock Objects can make something that&#8217;s nearly impossible to test a possibility.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a week!</p>


	<p>By the end of Thursday the 23rd, all of the necessary elements to complete my 360 feedback project were in place.  I&#8217;ll just be straightening up until the 1st.  Next week of work is my lightest in months.</p>


	<p>The project <i>knock on wood</i> looks to me like it will be a total success.  We&#8217;ve been kicking the tires on the remote server for weeks now.  I feel like I hit both date targets, even though I was lucky.  We were under budget.  Now all we need is a successful session or two, and that&#8217;ll be that.</p>


	<p>Also, I put down a deposit on a new place yesterday.  I&#8217;m moving out.  It&#8217;s an absolutely huge 2 bedroom in Richmond&#8217;s &#8220;Fan&#8221; area.  It&#8217;s the French Quarter, but more watered down and not French.  If I knew more about the Montrose area in Houston, I might say it was similar to that.  2,200 sq. ft for $850 a month is nice.  The house is almost a hundred years old.  Corner stores, markets, restaurants, and bars are all within walking distance.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;ll be the most alone I&#8217;ve been in seven years.  We&#8217;ll have to see how that goes.</p>


	<p>Well, what do you think of that?  I&#8217;ll be in Richmond till 2005.  Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s an improvement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Naked Objects is a <a href="http://www.nakedobjects.org/content.html"> thoroughly researched</a> assessment of the focus problems of our industry.  We deal with technical problems, day in and day out, so it&#8217;s easy to avoid the big, scary questions.  Naked Objects ask the question, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we just write the business objects and leave the rest to the user?&#8221;</p>


	<p>While I doubt that I&#8217;ll adopt the framework for projects in their entirety, I can easily see using the rapid prototyping capabilities.  How about whipping up something that actually worked between the first two days of a preliminary requirements meeting?  And then being able to keep that around to test the early stages of your persistence framework and interface?  I&#8217;ll keep you posted on any futher developments or use of the framework.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://statcvs.sourceforge.net/">StatCVS</a> reports that I&#8217;ve just recently cleared 10,000 lines of code.  A lot of those are in the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/">JFreeReport</a> code that I&#8217;ve just recently added, but I think they still count.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s a launch date of June 1, so I&#8217;ll get next week to do the straightening up and fixing a few known defects.  Then it&#8217;ll be off to the races!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m so fortunate at how this week has turned out.  One week ago today, it seemed like the project was already in the yellow and headed quickly towards the red.  I caught one last break, having good luck with laying out those reports myself.  So here we are!</p>


	<p>Be on the lookout in the near future for write-ups and notes of my future progress.  June should be a good month for learning!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
If you&#8217;re working with a server-side application, like I am, that imports a <pre>javax.swing</pre> package, you might get strange errors, such as the one described <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2545939">here</a>.  <pre>javax.swing</pre> packages expect to find an <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/"><span class="caps">X11</span> server</a> running on the machine.  In my case, it wants to access the graphical subsystem because <a href="http://www.jfree.org/">JFreeReport</a> wants to use a <pre>TableModel</pre> as a kind of spreadsheet.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>append <pre>java.awt.headless=true</pre> to your <pre>JAVA_OPTS&lt;pre&gt; in catalina.sh.  Mine ended up looking like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
JAVA_OPTS=-Dsalmon.props.path=/home/opgi/bin/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.30/salmon/properties
JAVA_OPTS = "$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.awt.headless=true"
&lt;/pre&gt;
