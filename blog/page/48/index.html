  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, even though my boss said he&#8217;d try not to throw me into the deep end&#8212;there I am!  I&#8217;ve been requested by the QA/QC (that&#8217;s Quality Assurance/Quality Control for the non-droids out there) department head to come take a look at their processes.  So now I&#8217;m glad I read that consulting book!</p>


	<p>In other job news, the miscellaneous web tasks have been no problem.  Work on the web application framework is progressing well, and when I&#8217;m finished, I should have something pretty nice to offer the public.  Yeah, sure, you probably could care less, but I&#8217;ve spent almost a week on it now, so somebody will appreciate the Google search that turns that up!</p>


	<p>But I still love the job.  There&#8217;s so much I&#8217;m learning so quickly&#8230;  I&#8217;ll make my mistakes and take my bumps, but this is a time in my life I can do something like this.  Just work and work like crazy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a <span class="caps">YMCA</span> member!  I signed up a couple days ago, and this morning I had my first workout.  They&#8217;ve got these wild machines that you identify yourself to, and they remember things like where you should put the pegs and seats, and how many reps to do at what weight.  They even beep at you to make sure that you&#8217;re doing the exercize appropriately.</p>


	<p>It also enables this great program they have to keep track of what they call <i>FitPoints</i> which sounds pretty lame, but it gives you immediate positive feedback about your workout.  They also give you cool stuff for racking up the points!  Just to show you it&#8217;s not all about the business model down at the Y&#8230;</p>


	<p>At any rate, I got about 300 with today&#8217;s one circuit on the weight machines and a half-hour cardio session.  I&#8217;ll be headed back tomorrow for more.  I must get that koozie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&#8217;m back from Maryville.  It was a great trip.  I had a blast hanging out with Jess and Jenn.  I can tell Jenn appreciated my visit because she must have thanked me fifteen times on the ride back from a party on Saturday night.  If you&#8217;re reading this, really, it was my pleasure.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m planning on getting back sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I&#8217;d love to go down every weekend, but looks like I&#8217;ll have to work on some of them coming up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The third Madden season ended up undefeated, the second one in a row.  I wasn&#8217;t making it a goal, it just worked out that way.  In the fourth season, I&#8217;ve faced my first real difficulty as a GM, having to let go two or three of the major players.  Aaron Glenn was a real loss.  I traded down my first round pick for a Gary Walker replacement, and the pick that became Kris Brown&#8217;s replacement.  All those replacements are headed to the Pro Bowl, even though it doesn&#8217;t even look like Glenn&#8217;s replacement is the best corner on my team, on paper.</p>


	<p>Once again, my live drafted fantasy football teams have tanked.  I&#8217;m wondering if I should even continue trying.  Also, with my pick &#8216;em record this year, I&#8217;m considering that gambling thing&#8230;  Oh, who am I kidding.  Isn&#8217;t that illegal?</p>


	<p>I still haven&#8217;t heard any sportswriter mention that the Marlins paid Mike Hampton $10 million to pitch for the Braves this year.  Isn&#8217;t that like twenty percent of their payroll?  Is anyone going to watch Marlin baseball next year?  I don&#8217;t have these answers.</p>


	<p>Is it me, or was this one of the most exciting post-seasons in recent history?  The post season went a grand total of three games under the maximum.  There were folds and great performances along the way, lots of exciting storylines&#8230;  Yet for some reason I really didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as I might have.  I remember the Marlins and Indians series being more exciting.</p>


	<p>Is it time for basketball already?  I&#8217;m not ready!  Can&#8217;t we just cancel the season already?  Or maybe get rid of like half the teams?  I&#8217;m watching this season under protest.</p>


	<p>For all the shit that people are talking about the Eagles, they&#8217;re one game back in the <span class="caps">NFC</span> East.  Don&#8217;t sportscasters look at the standings?</p>


	<p>I like Brent Jones in the booth.  I like Michael Irvin in the commentator&#8217;s chair.  I really don&#8217;t have an opinion on Rush&#8217;s politics (besides thinking he&#8217;s a comedian), but his sports commentary was wanting.</p>


	<p>I think that&#8217;s it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dad was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573221112/jimvanfleetco-20">The Art of Happiness</a> by the Dalai Lama on an airplane.  His neighbor asked him if it was any good.  That&#8217;s where it all started.</p>


	<p>Turns out he was from Rice, a religious studies major.  (He actually knows the guy who masterminded the Willie&#8217;s statue escapade!)  He was interested in my particulars since my dad said I was looking for work.  We met for dinner about a week ago and had a great interview.  I took on a little project for them, and they must have liked how that turned out, because I&#8217;m now an employee!</p>


	<p>For tax purposes, who knows exactly how it&#8217;ll look.  But I have a monthly salary, and that&#8217;s all I was looking for.  Prospects look good for long term work there.  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been no music reviews.  For those that know me, you&#8217;re probably wondering what the hell that&#8217;s all about.  The answer is this:  I&#8217;m learning how to make it one of the cornerstones of my personal site.  This job is going to be the final piece for me.  Once I get a certain portion of it done, I&#8217;ll be able to whip some applications out almost on a whim.  It stands on the brink of completion.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I put in a big order for new rekkids at <a href="http://www.sandbox-automatic.com/">Sandbox </a> which is the source for good, underground hip-hop.  I promise to finally share some reviews, even if the big framework isn&#8217;t in place yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went up on Sunday morning, stopping at the house of the guy who was hooking us up with the tickets.  We were there long enough to grab a doughnut, then it was off to FedEx field.</p>


	<p>The drive from where we were was really interesting.  We passed by the Washington Mall, and saw many of our nation&#8217;s treasures.  Mom and I were planning on browsing this area the next day, while Dad worked.  It was the first time I had been to DC since I was about fifteen, so that was refreshing.  I wasn&#8217;t into things like looking at maps at that point.</p>


	<p>When we got there, we kind of had to pull one over on the box guards to get three Van Fleet&#8217;s in with two tickets.  I went out to the smoking balcony and waited while my dad went to the box, then came back with Mom&#8217;s pass.  Boom, I was in.</p>


	<p>The game was really enjoyable, but this is now two professional events in a row I&#8217;ve watched <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020809.html">in the box</a>.  That&#8217;s really a whole other kind of event.  Roughly 8.7 seconds after the &#8216;Skins looked like they might be bringing the house down on their heads, the focus became watching as many of the <span class="caps">NFL</span> games as possible.  I&#8217;m down with that.  We all had enough great, free food that we didn&#8217;t even need to eat dinner later.  I&#8217;m just kind of upset that I got a little drunk on our beer the night before so I couldn&#8217;t enjoy the free stuff in the box.</p>


	<p>We watched six innings of Josh Beckett&#8217;s two-hit shutout, and hated every second of it.</p>


	<p>After that, we were at the guy&#8217;s house and had some after-game snacks and dessert.  Yeah, that sounds horrible, huh?  Then it was back to the hotel room to watch fourth season Sopranos and Carnivale.  I really liked the first few episodes of Carnivale, but it&#8217;s gone downhill a bit.  Hopefully it&#8217;ll pick back up; I enjoy my high weirdness.</p>


	<p>The next day, Mom and I hit some museums.  For some reason, I remembered the Air and Space museum having an Omnimax theatre.  I have this memory of watching an Imax movie in the planetarium posture&#8212;almost laying down.  This may not even really exist.  It certainly wasn&#8217;t at the Air and Space museum.  We did a couple of the things around there, but it really wasn&#8217;t that educational.  I&#8217;m sure I could have learned a great deal about war, but that&#8217;s really not an interest of mine.</p>


	<p>The next stop was a great exhibit at the Smithsonian called <a href="http://genome.pfizer.com/">Genome</a>.  It had great depth and breadth into its subjects, and really got my mind going.  I love when that happens.</p>


	<p>After that, we shopped for some clothes, went to dinner, and came back home.  That&#8217;s one enjoyable weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I completed my unbeaten season awhile ago with a convincing victory over the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl.  David Carr finished with league records in TD passes and passer rating.  Corey Bradford set a record with 24 TD catches.  Aaron Glenn set a <span class="caps">NFL</span> record by returning an interception 103 yards for a score.  It was not a pleasant season for the rest of the <span class="caps">NFL</span>.</p>


	<p>Now, for season three.  Exploiting a little bit of a hole in the Madden <span class="caps">CPU</span> owner logic, in week six I traded my first round pick to Arizona for theirs.  So I moved from the 32nd pick to the 3rd, straight up.  I did similar things in the second and third rounds (to different teams).  The Kid refers to the fella I picked up with the third pick.  In a few years, he&#8217;ll be as good as Priest Holmes&#8212;and cheaper.  He&#8217;s got a ton of touchdowns, and watching him catch passes out of the backfield gives my offense an entirely new dimension.  I also got at least three other impact players in the draft: a starting outside linebacker in the second round, an excellent backup strong safety who&#8217;ll see action in some situations in the third round, and a great kick returner in the sixth round.  I haven&#8217;t gotten to the regular season yet, because I have real work to do for a little while.  Oh well!</p>
