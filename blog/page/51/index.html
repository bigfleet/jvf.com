  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just realized that I got the old Milton treatment.  I&#8217;ve been moved from the office I was working in, which was average, to the lab.  It&#8217;s huge, but imagine a room that&#8217;s no one&#8217;s responsibility that a bunch of comps have access to.</p>


<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a total mess.  Trash on top of boxes on top of monitors</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll have to bring the minidisc with me every day.  There&#8217;s about ten servers in here, so it&#8217;s like someone sitting next to me, whistling.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve got about as much room as an airline passenger at my desk.</li>
</ol>

	<p>There&#8217;s a typewriter in here, which is a fun throwback, but this is going to hamper my productivity today.  I think I&#8217;ll go play a game or shop or something in protest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s not my rant, but it is funny.  Neal Stephenson, the author of Cryptonomicon (among others), whipped up this impressive work called <a href="http://www.spack.org/index.cgi/InTheBeginningWasTheCommandLine">In The Beginning, There Was The Command Line</a>.  I don&#8217;t know why he did it, but it&#8217;s easier to read than you might expect for a piece on the history of operating systems.  You&#8217;ll know more than you did when you started, probably.</p>


	<p>I might eventually write an expanded entry with my own comments on the work, but I was reminded of this piece&#8217;s existence this morning and wanted to get it up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And what a shock!  His film about <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=638&#38;ncid=579&#38;e=1&#38;u=/nm/20030812/en_nm/leisure_thepassion_dc">the crucifixion of Jesus</a> managed to strike a nerve.  My question, if it was shot entirely in Latin and Aramaic with no subtitles, why would they think the type of person to just start hating Jews would even want to go see it?</p>


	<p>Also, the Houston Press just did an <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2003-07-24/news.html/1/index.html">interview with Gibson&#8217;s dad</a>.  I found it pretty interesting.</p>

<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Jim joins the 21st century</strong></font></dt>
<dd>There&#8217;s a cell phone with my name on it in Virginia with the folks.  This&#8217;ll be a first for me, not counting the two weeks I had Erin&#8217;s cell phone.  At least I&#8217;ve finally established a history of not losing important electronic items!</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>I went on a &#8220;date.&#8221;</strong></font></dt>
<dd>It wasn&#8217;t the first one.  I&#8217;ve met both girls on the Internet, as I really don&#8217;t feel the internal strength to go out and give it a try.  It&#8217;s not that I care about getting hurt, it&#8217;s just exhausting and I&#8217;m already tired.  By the way, both girls apparently just decided to not reply to some communication from me.  Is this <i>en vogue</i> now?  I see why it pisses women off so much.  I could care less if they just didn&#8217;t think there wasn&#8217;t any chemistry.  Because they&#8217;re right, there hasn&#8217;t been any.  But as it is, it still pops up in my brain every now and again.  Annoying.</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Moving appointment</strong></font></dt>
<dd>The movers are coming to give me a quote Wednesday morning.  I&#8217;m sick of Houston.  I&#8217;m in a pattern here that I need help to get myself out of, and moving should be just the ticket.  Living with somebody responsible helps you get in good habits.  I can start them, no problem, but I need help to keep them going.</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Vacation coming</strong></font></dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m headed to Virginia Beach next week!  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to get to the beach.  Hopefully that week will be all I need to get the Seba project completed, and I&#8217;m could probably finish at least two books.  I&#8217;ve got 100 pages or so left on two different ones.  It&#8217;s been so long since I took three books on a beach trip!  Just thinking about the ocean relaxes me.</dd>

	<p>That&#8217;s it for now, peeps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friendster shakes you up with four levels of friends, stirs, and lets settle.  It was originally started as a dating service (interestingly enough), but I think it&#8217;s kind of interesting to see from a purely network/information point of view.  You can also people watch without getting out of your chair.</p>


	<p>In short, go ahead and join.  Why not?  I should be registered with my bigfleet address, which will go out of commission shortly after a six year run.  That&#8217;s like 72 in Internet years.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve heard some people talk bad about it, including me.  The first time I logged on, I was like &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?&#8221;  It gets a lot more interesting as your membership becomes official and you add a couple of friend links.  I&#8217;m linked to twelve girls in Houston with three friends who (to my knowledge) have never even visited here.  Freaky stuff.</p>


	<p>One guy on one of my mailing lists said &#8220;It&#8217;s a popularity contest, just like high-school.&#8221;  Well, who cares?  Let them win.  I just want to see interesting stuff, and it certainly helped pass some time at work today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>He&#8217;s very up front with the fact that such an account has to be, in some sense, oversimplified.  He repeats it, as well as other ideas, in the book, many times.  &#8220;We got it already!&#8221; you want to say.  You might even do it, but he can&#8217;t hear you.</p>


	<p>His points, however, don&#8217;t need the full body of knowledge from these topics to be applicable.  It&#8217;s sufficient for him to capture their flavor, and he does well with that.  By Chapter 17, when he describes a shoreline city on an Oceanic island featuring two story wood houses all along the beachfront, and he calls it &#8220;the equivalent of Downtown Manhattan,&#8221; I not only believed him, but marvelled at their construction.</p>


	<p>The genesis of the book lies in a trip to New Guinea that the author took in 1972.  He knew a fellow there named Yali, who was an engaging, bright fellow, involved in island politics.  He had many discussions with the author and, during one of them, he asked why &#8220;your people&#8221; had so much &#8220;cargo&#8221; (i.e. trappings of society) and his people had almost none.  The author was taken aback, since he had no real answer.  His purpose in writing the book was to provide an answer to that question:  why did human history follow the course it did?</p>


	<p>What a question, right?  But I was left with no doubt that the issues he presents in the book must play a factor in why, for example, Europe colonized the Americas, instead of the other way around.</p>


	<p>The major answers have to do with the move of a populace from a hunter/gatherer existence to a food producing existence.  The ability of a people to have specialists concentrating in areas besides food production allowed them obvious benefits, like increased militaristic might, and many others which he details.  This step begins a chain of other steps that societies wordwide have independently taken, which is fascinating to me.  Some are developed everywhere, most are developed only in certain areas.</p>


	<p>He details the effects that certain environmental facts had on this process of development on different continents.  As he progresses through each one, you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;re hearing some ideas over and over.  (Maybe I can repeat this idea one more time in this review, just to show I&#8217;m in the spirit!)  I normally find this very annoying, but the amount of new content in the book was so refreshing that I found it easy to ignore.</p>


	<p>What perhaps makes this book even more intriguing is that it claims to be the beginning of this kind of research.  There are many unexplored avenues which he brings up.  The most interesting to me only gets a couple of paragraphs worth of coverage in this book;  why did Europe massively populate the Americas circa 1500 AD and not China?  The author makes a hypothesis, which he admits needs work in his afterword.</p>


	<p>I think you&#8217;ll find the book exciting to read, overall.  Some of the stuff about what kinds of grains are native to which continent might be suitable for reading in bed (zzz&#8230;) but just few pages later you&#8217;re treated to images of elephants terrorizing their &#8220;masters&#8221; and zebras preferring death by collision to domestication.  I give it a straight <strong>9/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even though I wasted about an hour getting out of Houston by not double-checking my route before I left, I got to Austin in time for a late dinner.  We had some beers and some of the best portobello mushrooms I&#8217;ve ever had, while talking each other&#8217;s ears off.  It was one of those conversations that makes you glad to be alive, when you feel like there&#8217;s meaning in what&#8217;s happening to all of us, and it&#8217;s not just some sort of brutal randomness.</p>


	<p>All I was expecting for the next day was some frisbee, but we ended up heading to Lake Travis.  I had never even heard of it before the trip up.  It wasn&#8217;t exactly like any lake I had ever been to before.  One bank was relatively high-faced cliffs while the other was just like any other bank of a lake that you&#8217;ve seen.  Houses, piers, that sort of thing.  While the lake isn&#8217;t the ocean in terms of being able to calm me down, it sure was beautiful.  For what seemed like a half-hour, I just sat there and watched the sun reflect off the tops of waves, thinking that it was some message I just couldn&#8217;t understand.  Then Chet and Rocky came breaking up the party with their jet-skis, but I can&#8217;t hold that against them.  How should they know any better?</p>


	<p>After naps for the both of us, we ducked a party at his neighbor&#8217;s.  I guess I&#8217;m not the only person to ever pull something like that.  We went to go see Capturing the Friedman&#8217;s instead.  I&#8217;ll probably review it at some point; it was enjoyable.  There&#8217;s quite a queue forming for that kind of action!  I&#8217;m finishing stuff right and left lately.</p>


	<p>After waiting out the party a little, I managed to get to sleep.  I left before lunch the next day to get bak to my kitties, get the laundry done, get my place cleaned up, all that fun stuff.  All in all, the weekend was a total success.    It&#8217;s been awhile since I got any sun, and it reminds me of happy times seeing that pink face in the mirror.</p>


	<p>So, thanks again, Eric!  And you all should take a little weekend for yourselves sometimes.  Assuming you don&#8217;t in the first place.  Slackers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Escaflowne is a 24 episode animated series with a fantasy flavor.  It begins with our main character, Hitomi, in the middle of a typical kind of high-school romance situation.  It&#8217;s complicated somewhat by the fact that when she&#8217;s about to get this kiss she&#8217;s worked really hard for, a frigging dragon appears from nowhere and (luckily) so does this high-school age kid fighting it with <strong>ahem</strong> a sword.  Go, kid!  Anyway, Hitomi steps in to help a bit during the fight, having a premonition about a particular way in which the dragon will split the kid in two.  As a reward, she gets transported along with the kid, who turns out to be named Van <strong>(represent!)</strong> to his magical world of mystery.</p>


	<p>When they get there, you&#8217;re in for a hell of a story.  You&#8217;ve got plenty of characters, and lots of plot.  It&#8217;s understandable how this series could get compared to Evangelion, because of their similarities: they&#8217;re both about the same running time, they both have robots piloted by teens, striving against some mysterious enemy.  Even with these similarities though, it&#8217;s like comparing Requiem for a Dream with Reefer Madness because of the anti-drug messages and junkies.</p>


	<p>Escaflowne really doesn&#8217;t compare favorably with Evangelion, but that&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of.  Evangelion&#8217;s plot, which can be fairly inscrutable at times, is replaced with fantasy storytelling, which is a little easier to pull off.  It&#8217;s well done, although with fantasy stories, the credibility bar is lowered.  Even still, late episodes manage to strain the limits.  Especially when one main character turns out to be another rarely mentioned other character for&#8230; no apparent reason!</p>


	<p>Since Escaflowne is not trying to say anything terribly important, you can only judge it on how fun of a ride it is.  The fantasy story starts out really, really well.  The first three quarters of the story are completely involving, and I wouldn&#8217;t have a problem recommending the series, even though the conclusion really just manages to keep the story inside the lines.</p>


	<p>All the subplots are like a soap opera, with all the main characters having a romantic interest in at least one other character, and in one case, up to three.  You can&#8217;t really treat them seriously (alhough the characters certainly seem to), but what happens seems plausible enough to me.  This has to be taken with a grain of salt, though, when two characters get hit with a &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221; ray.  I mean, really.</p>


	<p>All in all, though, it&#8217;s worth it.  If you like anime, you&#8217;ll probably like Escaflowne.  I&#8217;ll give it an <strong>8.2/10</strong></p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: (1/6/05)</strong>:  I now own the series on <span class="caps">DVD</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When he last came to Houston, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ne/pedrothelion/">Pedro the Lion</a> gave this recommendation to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000G02H/jimvanfleetco-20">Punch Drunk Love</a>, the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>


<blockquote>
It&#8217;s really good&#8230;  It&#8217;s kind of like when you hear a band is going to put out a new record and you hear what&#8217;s it&#8217;s going to be all about, and it&#8217;s a little weird because you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be good, but then it kicks ass.  After Magnolia, I heard he was doing an Adam Sandler movie, and that sounded like about the dumbest thing I had ever heard, but it&#8217;s fucking great.
</blockquote>

	<p>I, too, was shocked by how much I liked this movie.  Towards the conclusion, I was starting to wonder &#8220;Am I going to give this movie five stars?  Seriously?&#8221;</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s the story of Barry Egan, a man who&#8217;s built his own business selling toilet plungers.  He has seven sisters, all of whom seem to take quite a bit of pleasure emasculating Barry, while curiously seeming to care a great deal about him.  I&#8217;m not one to judge whether this kind of behavior makes sense, but it certainly works to make its point in the film.  After all, it&#8217;s Barry&#8217;s story.</p>


	<p>Barry has a lot of problems which all interweave with each other in a way that makes real sense to me.  He is horribly embarrased by certain personal facts about himself and claims ignorance when confronted with actions that need explanations.  He&#8217;s afraid of showing his inner self because he&#8217;s had such horrible luck trusting people.  His sisters, even though they think they&#8217;re acting in his best interest, are part of his problem in that respect.  He&#8217;s forced to trust fairly random people, like a dentist married to one of his sisters, with these massive personal problems.  He also has no judgement in whom to trust, like that dentist incident, and a call to a phone sex line which propels one of the plot lines.</p>


	<p>He&#8217;s painfully nervous when he meets Our Girl, played by Emily Watson.  One of the only deductions I give this movie is that if she and Barry are to have the kind of connection shown in the movie, we need more background about how <strong>she</strong> got there.  This is a minor deduction, because again, this is Barry&#8217;s story.  As he decides what he wants, he becomes a new man, like so many men do when they find themselves in love.  In facing a situation which you suspect might have driven Barry over the edge, one way or the other, instead he faces it down and puts it to rest.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t think I could have handled a non-happy ending to this story, and luckily, I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s hard to know exactly what to give this movie.  Is it one of the best movies ever?  I don&#8217;t exactly want to say so, it seems too peculiar.  Since I happen to be peculiar, that&#8217;s no problem for me, but still.  Is there a way the movie could have been appreciably better?  I don&#8217;t think so.  Did I enjoy the movie?  Very much.  I have to give it a <strong>9.6/10</strong> and tell you to watch it.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305882592/jimvanfleetco-20">Harold and Maude</a> was supposed to be the second half of a Hal Ashby double bill.  The first half was going to be Being There, but unfortunately, I think it sucked.  As it turns out, it was the second half of a double-feature that&#8217;s all about the love.</p>


	<p>As a love story, it&#8217;s strangely pedestrian.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly crazy that a young man could fall for a&#8212;geriatric (<i>giggle</i>) when she&#8217;s so full of life.  He clearly needs that kind of influence badly, and she just effortlessly breaks through his little boy-shield.  After that, he&#8217;ll be hanging on for the rest of the ride.  That much makes sense to me.  It&#8217;s also typically boyish of him to completely miss the references she makes to ending her life throughout the film.</p>


	<p>The humor of the movie is what&#8217;s really exceptional.  The repeated suicide attempts never failed to amuse.  The supporting cast all work.  The no-longer-amused mother, the military general uncle, the psychiatrist (who disconcertingly is dressed exactly the same as Harold in an early scene), they&#8217;re all great.  The humor is what makes this movie a <strong>6.8/10</strong>, instead of something totally forgettable you&#8217;d see on Lifetime.  That&#8217;s a +.2 for Cat Stevens.</p>
