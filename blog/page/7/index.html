  <div class="entry-content">I lost track of everybody who sent this.  <a href="http://vinnie.me/post/64393782/memeing-it-up-or-7-things-you-didnt-know-about-me">@vinnie</a> did it via DM, so he gets name checked, but feel free to leave a comment if you can provide evidence that you did it first.

1. I was a DJ in college at <a href="http://bang.rice.edu/"><span class="caps">KTRU</span></a> for several years.   (I probably scanned that logo.)  My favorite story came during my first shift when I satisfied all my playlist requirements during the first hour of my shift, then played <a href="http://tinyurl.com/brainfreeze-album">Brainfreeze</a> in its entirety for the second hour.  I had one caller who claimed to be on their way to their probation hearing prior to returning to jail, but Brainfreeze still put a smile on their face.

2. My three cats are a Volunteer, a Longhorn, and a Tar Heel.

3. I have probably imbibed 100 cases of Cherry Coke Zero this year.

4. My middle name, Alanson (uh-LAN-son), has been in my family for three generations.  It is my father’s first name, and his father’s middle name.

5. I have been a part of a volunteer, non-profit organization called <a href="http://www.cisv.org/"><span class="caps">CISV</span></a> since I was 11 years old.  Its message is that children are basically the same the world around, but they grow up in different cultures.  I haven’t lived in the same city as a chapter since I was in high-school, but I have never stopped volunteering.

6. I am a recovering video game “addict”.  I think Megan may hate World Of Warcraft more than anything in the entire world.  I probably logged thousands of hours on Super Smash Brothers for the <span class="caps">N64</span>.  I once won a game of <span class="caps">NCAA</span> Basketball on the <span class="caps">SNES 132</span>-0 <strong>without using the reset button</strong>.  I found every exit on Super Mario World for each of the three saved game slots.  I am pretty sure I spent my entire freshman year playing Diablo and reading comic books.

7.  If I were to review my resume for college application at this point in my life, I doubt that I could remember 50% of the things on it, even though I know I must have done them.

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
		<p>What does your environment look like these days?  Still using TextMate or have you moved on to something better?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p><cite style="float:right;margin-right:10%"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peter_braswell">@peter_braswell</a></cite></p>


	<h2>There&#8217;s TextMate&#8230;</h2>


	<p>I still use TextMate.  It still has a lot to offer, and to me, it&#8217;s the most natural environment.  Here are the additional bundles that I have as a part of my installation.</p>


	<h3>GetBundles</h3>


	<p>Available from <span class="caps">SVN</span> <a href="http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/GetBundles.tmbundle/">here</a>, GetBundles is your one-stop shop for getting these bundles and more.  Check it out, absolutely.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://somethinglearned.com/articles/2008/06/03/ack-tmbundle-a-faster-find-in-project-for-textmate"><strong>Ack in TextMate</strong></a></h4>


	<p>(Also interesting is the <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/12/11/get-to-know-a-gem-rak">rak gem</a> for Ruby, if you are into the command line.)</p>


	<h4> <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2008/git-bundle/"><strong>Git</strong></a></h4>


	<p>Use this to help you use git while you get used to it.  The command line is so powerful, you&#8217;ll probably have to end up learning to use it there, but in the meantime, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have some simple things at your fingertips.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>GitHub</strong></a></h4>


	<p>This is basically just a glorified <code>blame</code> right now, but I anticipate that I will be able to use it to quickly load and comment publicly on certain commits.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>rSpec</strong></a> and <a href="http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>Cucumber</strong></a></h4>


	<p>These are my friends for testing.  I&#8217;ll be using that material for a talk (or lengthier blog post) soon.</p>


	<h2>and everything else.</h2>


	<p>There are a lot of people trying out things like emacs and vim again.  What&#8217;s old is new again!  If either of these are your favorite editor, I&#8217;m sure you can poke around and find some good resources.</p>

	<p><cite style="float:right;margin-right:10%"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peter_braswell">@peter_braswell</a></cite></p>


	<h2>Dr. Nic&#8217;s Textmate Footnotes</h2>


	<p>Famous Railsist &#8220;Dr. Nic&#8221; has a great <a href="http://github.com/drnic/rails-footnotes/tree/master">footnotes plugin</a> which you can get a taste for from the <span class="caps">README</span> on that page.  It&#8217;s a must install if you choose TextMate as your editor.</p>


	<h2>Named scopes</h2>


	<p>Your Rails developer badge will shortly be revoked if you do not learn and use named scopes liberally.  The way that they can be named, composed, and reused in multiple contexts can result in some extremely powerful and expressive code, that remains readable and even has some excellent performance characteristics.</p>


	<p>Learn more at <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/108-named-scope">RailsCasts</a> and <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/3/24/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-has-finder-functionality">Ryan&#8217;s blog</a></p>


	<h2>will_paginate</h2>


	<p>Out of the box Rails pagination is a thing of the past, I think.  <a href="http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/master">will_paginate</a> is as much of a drop in as it gets, and it&#8217;s flexible in all the right ways.  It&#8217;s also kept very much up to date and remains in active development.</p>


	<h2>rSpec and cucumber</h2>


	<p>While I&#8217;ve decided that my overall thoughts on testing are probably going to end up being a talk, I can provide my favorites here.  <a href="http://rspec.info/">rSpec</a> provides a nicer syntax than test/unit for my tastes.  Further, the capabilities that come with the stories functionality provided by <a href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis">cucumber</a> (detailed by <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/rspec-user-stories">Peepcode</a>) have been a revelation on my primary project.</p>


	<h2>fixture_replacement2</h2>


	<p>I personally have come to dislike fixtures strongly.  There are definitely techniques that can be used to reduce their downsides, like <a href="http://github.com/aiwilliams/dataset/tree/master">dataset</a> (previously known as scenarios), but I favor leaving them behind altogether.  Once you&#8217;ve made <strong>that</strong> decision, you have options still, like <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/6/6/waiting-for-a-factory-girl">factory-girl</a> (plenty of good alternatives mentioned at that link, as well).  dataset even mentions that it can play along with other alternatives</p>


	<p>For my part, I&#8217;m satisfied with <a href="http://github.com/smtlaissezfaire/fixture-replacement-git/tree/master">fixture_replacement</a> which is in a second version.  It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s active, but I enjoy the flexibility that comes with being able to ask easily for objects that have or have not been persisted and they have the exact same set-up.  I hope to provide more detail there later.</p>


	<p>These are the only tips and techniques that I&#8217;d bring onto each project.  For anything else, I&#8217;d be checking out the diverse Rails ecosystem out there!  It&#8217;s getting more pleasant by the week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Question</h2>


	<blockquote>
		<p>What the latest/greatest sources of information/tutorials/gadgets for RoR is.  Sure I can Google, but I&#8217;d like to get recommendations from the source.  Maybe you have Delicious tags, dunno?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p><cite style="float:right;margin-right:10%"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peter_braswell">@peter_braswell</a></cite></p>


	<h2>Twitter</h2>


	<p>The Rails community does actually say what they&#8217;re up to.  The RubyLearning blog recently complied a list of the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/10/29/50-rubyists-to-follow-on-twitter/">top Rubyist Twitter personalities</a>.  This is a good way to be on the cutting edge without actually doing anything.  It can also help you engage directly with those who can help the most.</p>


	<h2>The Aggregators</h2>


	<p>Peter Cooper (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterc">@peterc</a>) runs <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">Ruby Inside</a> and <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/">Rails Inside</a> which aggregate and comment on a lot of what&#8217;s happening in the community.  Follow those and start from there to build a respectable blog roll.</p>


	<h2>Rails Core</h2>


	<p>Recently the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/">official Rails blog</a> has really stepped forward, but in quantity and quality of posts.  It&#8217;s also, of course, a canonical source for information.  Gregg Pollack&#8217;s &#8220;This Week in Rails&#8221; posts are a highlight, of course along with <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/">the original &#8216;What&#8217;s New in Edge Rails&#8217; series from a core contributor</a>.</p>


	<h2>Themes in Modern Rails</h2>


	<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>


	<p>A lot of successful companies that are using Rails have arrived at their success through a consultancy approach that focuses on green-field applications.  While Rails certainly <strong>can</strong> be used with legacy applications, it&#8217;s not really a secret that writing new applications is the bread and butter for Rails.  As a result, more and more bootstrapping supplements are available at the beginning of projects.  These have an aim of providing useful tools, or adding a few additional opinions to add to the pile of opinions Rails has about how you ought to be writing your apps.</p>


	<p>My understanding is that <a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">Bort</a> was one of the elements allowed during the recent <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble</a>.  <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a>, a respected consultancy that is <strong>absolutely killing it</strong> with their <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects">open source contributions</a>, offers <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/10/21/suspenders">suspenders</a>, which they use at the beginning of all their projects.  Others are also available, but these seem of particular importance.</p>


	<p>I personally have never used any of them, because I seemingly never start new projects.  They certainly may be of interest to those at the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; level today.</p>


	<h3>Git and GitHub</h3>


	<p><img src="http://images.nymag.com/images/2/news/07/05/week1/studio54/studio070507_1_600B.jpg" style="width:50%;float:right;padding:0px 0px 10px 10px;" alt="" /></p>


	<p>If <strong>any</strong> method for hosting your source code were <strong>ever</strong> to be compared to Studio 54, <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> would have to be it.  The process of hosting, contributing, documenting, and using <del>drugs</del> open source has never been easier.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/languages">en vogue among Rubyists</a> and you and your projects will be better of by learning and using Git.  (Protips available from <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, an outstanding source for info in its own right.)</p>


	<p>Git is a complete re-imagining of source control.  It&#8217;s not like the transition from <span class="caps">CVS</span> to <span class="caps">SVN</span>.  There are a lot more concepts to learn, and with more power comes more responsibility.  As my familiarity with git has grown, I am sure that I will never go back to Subversion.</p>


	<p>The fact that GitHub is so popular, with such an incredibly active and present ecosystem of open-source tools is just another layer of awesome on top. It looks like it might have been <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/3/2/migration-concordance">Josh Susser</a> who said that &#8220;GitHub is social networking for geeks.&#8221;</p>


	<h3>RailsCasts</h3>


	<p>In addition to the aforementioned <a href="http://www.peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, there are a few additional sources for screencasts.  I personally have most of those screencasts, and have never been disappointed.</p>


	<p><a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts">The Pragmatic Programmers screencasts</a> and the <a href="http://envycasts.com/">EnvyCast</a> series are also good.</p>


	<p>Although they deal with topics that aren&#8217;t always for beginners, the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> series is not to be missed.  Ryan Bates does a great job with consistently turning out quality work, and RailsCasts are free.</p>


	<h3>Delicious</h3>


	<p>I do occasionally tag <a href="http://delicious.com/bigfleet/rails">Rails</a> and <a href="http://delicious.com/bigfleet/ruby">Ruby</a> items of interest to me.  <span class="caps">YMMV</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Rocking Out</h2>


	<p>Since picking up the Wii version of Rock Band at the beach this summer, Megan and I have both really enjoyed it.  It turns out <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/">Megan Van Fleet</a> is an excellent drummer!  I don&#8217;t play drums that much, but when I do, I struggle on easy.  She can definitely get through all the songs on medium, only struggling on the hardest ones.  I&#8217;ve had to try to up my game and start practicing hard guitars, but we really don&#8217;t play that much.</p>


	<h2>I&#8217;m Not Fat, I&#8217;m Big Boned!</h2>


<div style="float:right; padding: 10px;">
<img src="http://www.southpark.ru/cartman.gif" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>As a part of my post-surgery life, I&#8217;ve been referred to <a href="http://www.elitept1.com/">Elite Physical Therapy</a> here in Charlotte, and it&#8217;s unbelievable.  Joe kicks my ass twice weekly, and has also taken his own time to show me how to kick my own ass at the Y.  I&#8217;ve got the pictures to prove it.</p>


	<p>As a result of physical therapy, I now consider myself 99.99% pain free.  There is only the slightest bit of very occasional bother.  We have been working on restoring my flexibility, core-strengthening (which relieves stress on the back), and recently more total body activities.  I have definitely learned that you do not need weights to get stronger; your own body can provide all the resistance you need.</p>


	<p>I am excited about getting back into a rhythm of going to the gym.  I went last night to do a full session on the elliptical runner, and I was reminded about how I used to start plenty of days that way.  It&#8217;s been over 18 months since the last time I was doing that, and I&#8217;ve definitely lost a few steps, but I came home energized.</p>


	<h2>Still a Geek</h2>


	<p><a href="http://charlotteruby.org/">charlotte.rb</a> has a new <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/136/">Meetup group</a> sponsored by the guys at <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>.  It has been a bit of a relief to have a chance to participate in a professional group that I did not have to start myself.</p>


	<p>I am working a lot more with Rails 2.1 and it&#8217;s new features.  I hope to be able to write up some of it soon.</p>


	<p>I am also working on a talk that I hope to present at RailsConf 2009&#8212; it won&#8217;t be just another Scaling Rails talk, I promise you that.  It&#8217;ll be the first talk I&#8217;ve ever really spent time and energy on, and I hope to have enough fun making it so that if it gets rejected, I will still think it was worth it.</p>


	<h2>Fall&#8217;s Season Passes</h2>


	<p>Farewell, Monk, Psych, In Plain Sight, and Burn Notice!  We will see you again soon.  Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re ready for this fall.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>House</li>
		<li>Heroes</li>
		<li>Pushing Daisies</li>
		<li>Project Runway (I&#8217;m getting destroyed this year in our <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/2008/08/listen-up-ladies.html">fantasy Project Runway showdown</a>)</li>
		<li>Desperate Housewives</li>
	</ul>


	<p>and Megan has these upstairs</p>


	<ul>
	<li>90210</li>
		<li><span class="caps">NCIS</span></li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Still Church Goers</h2>


	<p>For those of you who are familiar with my typical routine, it may surprise you that I really look forward to going to church each week.  Megan and I became members of the <a href="http://www.uuccharlotte.org/"><span class="caps">UUCC</span></a> earlier in the summer, and it&#8217;s something that we both look forward to every Sunday.  It encourages us both to better habits (like just <strong>going for it</strong> and waking up earlier) that we&#8217;ve both struggled with a bit at times.</p>


	<h2>Thanks</h2>


	<p>I am slowly getting around to writing letters to everyone that&#8217;s impacted my life.  My handwriting is bad enough that the experience may not be 100% pleasant for the recipient, but I was inspired by a service given by a guest speaker one week.  He read aloud a note that his son had written him years ago, in conjunction with a gift of a book.  It was clear, even years later, how this note made him feel so wonderful and happy.</p>


	<p>We all have the power to do that for the ones we love.  I want to encourage everyone to take a little bit of time out of your day to write from the heart to the people you love.  They will never forget it, and it will make you feel good, too.</p>


	<p>I, also, hope to write here more often.  I am trying to get back into a lot of habits, and sometimes the last thing I feel like when I get home is more keyboarding.</p>
