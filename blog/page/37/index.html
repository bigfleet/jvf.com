  <div class="entry-content"><p>My typical pattern of code development to this point has consisted of writing code that &#8220;works,&#8221; by trying your single implementation over and over again with tweaking until it gives you the results you want.  This normally brings the &#8220;Yay!&#8221; feeling and I go grab a beer.</p>


	<p>Now that I&#8217;m a year older, I realize that I&#8217;m at <strong>most</strong> 30% done.  There are two other responsibilities all developers should feel morally bound to provide with their code:  proof of correctness, and a maintainable state.</p>


	<p>Proof of correctness would normally be seen as an accompanying unit test suite.  This is probably the best solution, but I can&#8217;t say that yet.  I know it&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m most comfortable using.  Some sort of formal documentation (not formal, as in, no visible pizza droppings, formal as in discrete math or logic) might be used instead for the right kind of problem.  This ensures that there is at least somewhere to start when your solution ends up working only 95% or even 99% of the time, or when things change into the future, and someone who has never met you has to start working with your code anew.</p>


	<p>Maintainable state has many criterion.  Is your code written to some sort of coding conventions for variable naming and static access?  What&#8217;s your package structure like?  How easy is it to &#8220;translate&#8221; domain concerns and find them in the code?  If there were no &#8220;copy and paste,&#8221; could the project have been completed at all?</p>


	<p>Those who come after you will end up paying the costs that you have deferred to them without an effort to do these things.</p>


	<p>This is why I&#8217;m starting to multiply my estimates by eight to determine how long a task will really take.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here at work, some of our legacy code has the problem of primitive <span class="inlineCode">double</span> and <span class="inlineCode">float</span> primitives turning into scientific notation when they are concatenated to a String.  Hence, a <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement ends up trying to use numbers with letters in them, and that&#8217;s not going to work.</p>

<p>The solution is to use your friend the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html">java.text.NumberFormat</a> class.  After using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html#setGroupingUsed(boolean)">setGroupingUsed(boolean)</a> and the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html#setMaximumIntegerDigits(int)">setMaximumIntegerDigits(int)</a> methods, my problems were over.</p>

<p>After I combed through all the code, bumping my way into places it was used.  See the next quickie.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, I took off in a hurry.  I had Allie&#8217;s flight times wrong, and wanted to leave her waiting at the airport no more than necessary.  We all know waiting at airports is pretty far down on the list of &#8220;Pleasant Activities.&#8221;  I left the directions to <span class="caps">RDU</span> behind on my printer, but I still drove straight there.</p>

<p>Delays in Chicago meant that I actually beat her to the airport by about an hour.  I got a magazine and cleaned out the car.  When her flight touched down, we were ready to bolt.  Allie was looking great!  Rumor has it that she&#8217;s on a diet&#8230;</p>

<p>We drove on down the way to dinner, then got ever-so-slightly off track on the way down to the beach.  We ended up getting in at around midnight.  Brady woke up, even though she said she wouldn&#8217;t, and we slid into our beds.</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Brady had to go to work early.  Allie and I got up a little late and hit <span class="caps">CVS</span> for various items we had left behind, then Arby&#8217;s for lunch.  After debating the merits of Spider-Man 2 versus The Bourne Supremacy, those merits were made moot by a bit of a problem popping up in work land.  That tied me more or less to the computer for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>My normal behavior under those circumstances would be to bug out.  I wouldn&#8217;t eat, I would worry, I&#8217;d put myself in the situation and get lost.  Start making mistakes.  This time, I took it easy, figured out what I needed to do, and did it.  I stayed up late, but I got it done.</p>

<p>In the middle, we had a lovely dinner.  It was one of the most enjoyable evenings I&#8217;ve spent in quite some time.  It reminded me of how I used to feel within this skin, and how it wouldn&#8217;t be out of the question for life to feel like that again.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Brady works hard for the money, so she was out the gate early again on Friday.  Allie and I again woke up a little later.  We hung out with Brady&#8217;s roommates, then went to the beach for a couple of hours.  Brandy, Brady&#8217;s friend, got stung by a jellyfish.  It&#8217;s the worst sting I had seen in some time, and she had a hard time walking on it for awhile.</p>

<p>After that, I had a talk with the group that might be taking over for me on the <span class="caps">OPGI 360</span> project.  That conversation went really well, and I got some validation that I had been producing good work all this time.  That felt great.  I&#8217;m very hopeful that we can make this transition, so I can once again focus on one job.</p>

<p>After that, we went out to Murphy&#8217;s Law.  It&#8217;s a pool hall and restaurant.  It doesn&#8217;t have very much in common with Monkey Junction in Wilmington, except the vibe.  We had dinner, then played a couple of games of pool and a game of darts.  It was even more fun.</p>

<p>We finished off with a very emotional discussion session.  We&#8217;ve all had our bumps on the trail, and we had a chance to talk about it in person.  It was very powerful, and it was nice to have that feeling back as well.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>Everybody woke up a little late.  As a crew, we all went into Myrtle Beach to have breakfast.  It was really good, but I don&#8217;t know if it was worth the drive.  After we dropped by the beach again, we went out to the grocery store to pick up stuff for dinner.  We got some tuna and veggies.  Since the girls weren&#8217;t confident in their grilling skills, I ended up on the grill.  After a couple of bumps in the road, we grilled it up and had a tasty, home-cooked meal.</p>

<p>The girls watched the Olympics finish up, and I watched the college football season get off to an excellent start.  VTech gave <span class="caps">USC</span> all it wanted, and both teams looked ready for the season, to say the least.  It was very easy to root for Tech.  After that, it was time for sleep!  Allie and I planned to get up at 4:30 AM to get her to her flight on time.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>Gaston had been reported as being in the area the night before.  It ended up just of the coast of Charleston for a long time, dropping rain on the area where we were.  After we woke up at 2:30, it just rained and rained.  Allie and I decided to get out of there, after seeing that the storm still hadn&#8217;t touched down.  All we had to do was beat feet and hit Interstate.  The plan worked like a charm, and everybody was home safe by noon.</p>

<p>Of course, then the trouble started.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I went out to check on my car for the first time, a couple of hours later, there was a wall of fireman preventing anyone from going anywhere into the area.  The water was visbly flowing quickly in a gigantic pool around the corner of 15th and Cary.  I was parked roughly at the corner of 16th and Cary, )if 16th were a real street), and I couldn&#8217;t see anything of my car.  I went back to the restaurant where my team was staying and hung out for a bit.  They left, but I declined their offer for ride home, since I wanted to see what happened to my car.</p>


	<p>I had dinner and then went to check again.  This time, there was no barricade and no water.  There were a lot of car horns going off, but my car was not where I had left it.  I wandered around most of the lot to confirm that it was gone.  At this point, it was time to walk home.  I fell over once when an area I knew to be solid ground was actually a mud bog about three inches deep.  I walked the thirty blocks or so to get home in about forty-five minutes.</p>


	<p>After calling in the insurance hounds, and making a tour of the tow yard where my car was most likely to end up, we finally found the car on the end of Tuesday.  We went to inspect it on Wednesday morning.  It was clear that it had been totally submerged.  The top was caved in a bit from an inch-thick layer of mud on top.  On the inside of the car, the roof had bits of twig and detritus that weren&#8217;t there when I left it last.  The whole affair was very stinky and sludgy, but we did retrieve a fair bit of the stuff that I wanted to keep.  I wasn&#8217;t too upset with losing anything that happened to be in the car at the time, except one computer book.</p>


	<p>Mom took the garbage bags of personal effects home to hose them down.  We went to a rental place and picked up a car, courtesy of State Farm.  That&#8217;s where we stand.  My car was totalled by about ten inches of rain in a four to six hour timeframe when parked at the bottom of a hill by a river.</p>


	<p>Next time, I&#8217;ll be in the garage!</p>
