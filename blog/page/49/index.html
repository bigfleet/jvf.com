  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why do we think God (or Christ) would care?  Why would he be on the side of Trot Nixon instead of the numerous praying players on the Oakland Athletics?  My own theories (which are far away from being solid enough to write down) would seem to skirt around these issues, and <span class="caps">ESPN</span> deals with this topic every year it seems like.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see it now that Outside the Lines has gone weekly.</p>


	<p>Moving to a less ethereal aspect, why does sport fascinate people?  My father, who would know this kind of thing, says that it&#8217;s one of the few activities that can be traced to prehistoric times.  You would think, in prehistoric times, that they should have been out hunting with their energy.  Doesn&#8217;t it seem like sports must have some kind of value?  Even if it does, however, is it limited to the prehistoric man level of value?  Is the value the feeling of togetherness in being with a team, or feeling like you&#8217;re the best at something so you can get hot chicks?</p>


	<p>If so, how do you explain figure skating?  Yeah, sure, it&#8217;s a sport.</p>


	<p>Is it some kind of fundamental beauty that we appreciate?  It&#8217;s a little late, and I&#8217;m a little pissed off at UT&#8217;s gameplan to beat Auburn tonight (hey, why run the ball at all?) so I&#8217;m not going to get too poetic, but I at least thought I&#8217;d get it down on paper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, my own Madden exploits.  I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to be a Houston Texans fan.  They have made some great personnel decisions and are putting together a team that I really like.  So it was a natural thing to pick them for my franchise in Madden.</p>


	<p>My first campaign ended at 10-6 and a playoff berth after winning my division. Baltimore came into my house and beat me, but I considered it a success.   I royally messed up the off-season, though, so I considered it a good training run.</p>


	<p>A couple of days ago, I finished my second campaign.  This one was 18-1 and a Super Bowl championship.  Stacey Mack was the <span class="caps">MVP</span> of the league with over 2,000 yards and 28 rushing touchdowns.  David Carr, Billy Miller and three lineman went to the Pro Bowl on the offensive end.  Aaron Glenn scored seven defensive touchdowns off interception returns.  He and Marcus Coleman went and started at cornerback.  In the off-season, I signed Warren Sapp.  Sapp a Texan!  Only in Madden.  I haven&#8217;t had this much fun playing Madden since the first one for the Super Nintendo.  The patented Randall Cunningham &#8211; Shotgun &#8211; Hail Mark combined with a bootleg run for 50 or 25 yards depending on if they were playing man or zone.  Now Madden has 3600 plays or so.</p>


	<p>Also, in our new <span class="caps">NFL</span> season, it looks like somebody&#8217;s in owner mode.  How else would you explain Peyton&#8217;s line in the New Orleans game and Jamal&#8217;s line against Cincinnati?  I just put it together&#8212;both graduated from Tennessee.  But the new <span class="caps">NFL</span> seasons looks intriguing.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what things look like in week 8.</p>


	<p>Peyton singlehandedly resurrected <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=83117">my </a> <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=246389">fantasy</a> <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=486421">chances </a> this year.  I lost my first two games, posting some of the worst scores I&#8217;ve ever put up in week one.  I was standing on the verge of 1-3 when Peyton outscored many teams singlehanded.  And of course, I cut Ashley Lelie and Drew Bennet before they could get going.  Stupid me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><font size="+1"><strong>Week One</strong></font>

	<p>On day one, I woke up in my bed with all my stuff still in the apartment, except the stuff I gave away.  By noon, everything was gone.  I waited on the Merry Maids to come help me keep my deposit.  (I ended up netting $20 on that little investment, go me!)  At that point the only thing left to do was hit the road!</p>


	<p>The first stop was Austin, TX.   I unloaded the kitties, who had had a rough day with every thing getting packed up including them.  When I let them out in Furbish&#8217;s empty room, I thought they&#8217;d be OK.  When I came back in later, two of them were in the litter box and the third was wedged between the box and the wall.  I&#8217;ve never seen them so upset.  I let them out to explore Casa Furbish and they repayed me by not peeing on any of his stuff.</p>


	<p>The reason I went a few hours out of my way was that I got to see <a href="http://www.mogwai.co.uk/">Mogwai</a>, probably the one band I could never justify missing.  Hopefully, I&#8217;ll get another chance to see them, but if it was the first and last, I&#8217;d be happy.  It was a very solid performance, and they did about half of my favorites, as well as half their new album.</p>


	<p>The next morning, I got on my way to Jackson, TN, to check in with Ashley Johnson, a friend of mine from Governor&#8217;s School.  When we met, she was Ashley James, meaning I got to meet her husband.  We were both Road Dogs on Wednesday, so we chilled out on Thursday, talked sports, and watched the hurricane hit the East Coast.  I really enjoyed my time there; they&#8217;ve got a great place, and the two of them are a good match.  That made me really happy.  Her job is in the Department of Human Services (think welfare) which isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;d expect from a conservative, but hey, nobody ever said the world made sense all the time.</p>


	<p>I made the 730 miles from Austin to Jackson in ten and a half hours, my best time ever for a trip of that length.  Had to put that in here.</p>


	<p>The next stop was Maryville.  When I first did the blogish thing back during Freshman year, I would put anything up.  These days, there are some things that are just too personal.  Some things might find there way up later, but not now.  The stay was good, and I saw everyone I needed to see, except one.</p>


	<p>The drive to Richmond went fine, and the kitties were glad to be off the road.</p>


<font size="+1"><strong>Week Two</strong></font>

	<p>Richmond rules.  The first thing you notice is that there are trees absolutely everywhere.  I saw more stars last night than I have an in extremely long time.    I wore jeans today, and it sounds like I&#8217;ll need to wear long sleeves by the end of the week.  I saw my breath tonight when I went outside.  I was ready for all these things again, I always liked seasonably cold weather.</p>


	<p>The traffic here appears to be pretty non-existent, which is something I&#8217;m overjoyed with.  I&#8217;ve been driving just a couple of times, and I already feel like I have a feel for the major roads, and that I could get anywhere I needed to.  That took me years in Houston.</p>


	<p>My room has come together quite well.  Mom&#8217;s got big plans for the downstairs, but when it&#8217;s writing on paper, it&#8217;s always tough for me to see.  In a couple of weeks, we&#8217;ll see how that&#8217;s shaping up.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I&#8217;ve got a great room already, so anything else after that will be gravy.</p>


	<p>So there you go.  That&#8217;s pretty much what I wanted to say, and I just wanted to break the ice on this site again.  I&#8217;ve been away too long, and it&#8217;s good to write.</p>


	<p>Peace!</p>


<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: (01/01/06)</strong>  That would be the last time I saw Jesse alive.  It was the first time I saw him essentially in constant pain.</p>

<time datetime="2003-09-01T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 1<span>st</span>, 2003</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first thing that I&#8217;ll say about the book is that it is hard to read.  It&#8217;s by far the most demanding of the non-fiction I&#8217;ve been reading.  This book has prerequisites if you want to read it.  <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">The Dancing Wu Li Masters</a> is a must, and I wish I had read <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385235690/jimvanfleetco-20">the other book that I bought about quantum physics</a> before this.  Prepare yourself, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>


	<p>The essence of <a href="http://superstringtheory.com/">superstring</a> theory is relatively simple;  you, if you ever did think about it, probably thought of the elementary particles as being points.  Superstring theory claims that they are, in fact, small strings vibrating in a certain way.  This theory can claim to incorporate gravity <strong>itself</strong> in a meaningful and fundamental way, predicting the properties of the gravitron.  This in itself is pretty exciting to physicists.  (Note that Einstein&#8217;s general relativity mentions gravity, but only to hand-wave it into accelerated motion).  There&#8217;s no doubt that the potential of string theory (as it&#8217;s more commonly known) is quite impressive.  It&#8217;s the first human attempt at an actual <a href="http://theoryofeverything.org/TOE/toe-4.htm">Theory of Everything</a>.  (In searching for that link, I also found <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">this one</a>, which has a really interesting picture.  &#8220;You are here.&#8221;)  Greene also notes that even opponents of string theory have no better or different theories as yet, and concede that their own areas of research seem to be stagnating.</p>


	<p>String theory also predicts seemingly crazy stuff, like the universe is not four space-time dimensions, but eleven.  The other seven spatial dimensions exist on such microscopic scales, however, that we&#8217;re unable to see or interact with them in any way.  Got that?  It also predicts that black holes have a temperature, which seems outlandish, but seems to actually be true.  This is one of the only testable bits of string theory.</p>


	<p>Therein lies the biggest criticism of string theory thus far;  there&#8217;s no way to tell if it&#8217;s right or wrong.  There&#8217;s hope that when a <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/cern/">supercollider in Geneva</a> becomes operational at the end of the decade that string theorists will finally have evidence for some of their theories.  Greene points out that even if string theory is wrong, the field has spurred new developments in &#8220;point physics&#8221;, so it&#8217;s not a total waste.</p>


	<p>So, in one sense, the book worked.  I&#8217;ll be paying attention to what that thing clears up, and I&#8217;ll actually try to answer people that wonder why we spend millions of dollars on these things.  Maybe it&#8217;ll go something like &#8220;So you can finally get your jet-pack to the eighth dimension, stupid!&#8221;  It does face deductions for ease of reading and potential relevance.  When all it said and done, though, it could be a great primer for a very important set of ideas about the universe.  I&#8217;ll give it <strong>8.4/10</strong>.</p>

<dd>I had two thoughts after I finished watching this movie.  The first was that &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe this movie is that old!&#8221;  Besides the &#8220;Haha, look at the scary communists!&#8221; factor we have in today&#8217;s viewings, during release, this was deadly serious stuff.  But this movie is about 60% plot (which you can read about elsewhere) and 40% well-done character development.  Sinatra himself has the flattest one, but he <strong>does</strong> know kung fu.

The other was that &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this movie hasn&#8217;t been remade.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure Hollywood will get around to it at some point.  They better hurry and get Jude Law:  he&#8217;s a dead ringer for the assassin!  I couldn&#8217;t recommend this movie more highly, anything that old which stands up that well deserves at least a <strong>9.4/10</strong></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>The Bridge On The River Kwai</strong></font></dt>
<dd>This one is more famous, and has Obi-Wan Kenobi in it.  Seriously, Alec Guiness is great in this movie, playing a British major who is determined to do things the &#8220;right&#8221; way.  By the time he&#8217;s almost convinced you, you realize he&#8217;s completely delusional and that time in the &#8216;hot box&#8217; probably fried his brains.  This is another war movie where the characters have depth, the plot is compelling.  It doesn&#8217;t dig straight to the soul of man the way I feel The Thin Red Line did, for instance, but it&#8217;s still worthwhile.  I give it an <strong>8.2/10</strong></dd>
