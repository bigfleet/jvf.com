  <div class="entry-content"><p>I completed my unbeaten season awhile ago with a convincing victory over the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl.  David Carr finished with league records in TD passes and passer rating.  Corey Bradford set a record with 24 TD catches.  Aaron Glenn set a <span class="caps">NFL</span> record by returning an interception 103 yards for a score.  It was not a pleasant season for the rest of the <span class="caps">NFL</span>.</p>


	<p>Now, for season three.  Exploiting a little bit of a hole in the Madden <span class="caps">CPU</span> owner logic, in week six I traded my first round pick to Arizona for theirs.  So I moved from the 32nd pick to the 3rd, straight up.  I did similar things in the second and third rounds (to different teams).  The Kid refers to the fella I picked up with the third pick.  In a few years, he&#8217;ll be as good as Priest Holmes&#8212;and cheaper.  He&#8217;s got a ton of touchdowns, and watching him catch passes out of the backfield gives my offense an entirely new dimension.  I also got at least three other impact players in the draft: a starting outside linebacker in the second round, an excellent backup strong safety who&#8217;ll see action in some situations in the third round, and a great kick returner in the sixth round.  I haven&#8217;t gotten to the regular season yet, because I have real work to do for a little while.  Oh well!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Philadelphia Phillies fan was <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=582&#38;e=4&#38;u=/nm/20031009/wr_nm/nl_phillies_spam_dc">arrested for spamming Philly papers</a>, and many other people.  I actually got a few of these spams.  I know I kept some of them for awhile;  they were actually well-written and very well thought out.  I didn&#8217;t exactly thing it was the best forum, but they were at least interesting.</p>


	<p>Why can&#8217;t they arrest the people who keep trying to get me to increase my breast size?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, Monday was a big day.  I had a phone interview for a position at Capital One, and a teleconference with Seba concerning the conclusion of a contracting job.  The interview went OK, and the teleconference couldn&#8217;t have gone better.  After that, me and Mom went to go watch School of Rock, which I&#8217;ll give a full review tomorrow probably.</p>


	<p>Today was a lot of fun, too.  I took delivery on the new Outkast album, and my birthday present for my dad.  I also got two books on database theory that will really help me with these contracting gigs if I keep doing that in the future.  I got my Virginia Driver&#8217;s License&#8212;that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m a resident now.</p>


	<p>My second Madden season has reached 9-10.  David Carr is leading the league in QB Rating, TD&#8217;s, and yardage.  I went 23 of 26 for 523 yards and 10 TD&#8217;s against the Colts.  Stacey Mack is leading the league in yardage and TD&#8217;s.  The top two receivers are Corey Bradford (?!) and Andre Johnson.  Andre was out for a month, which helped Corey out.  Billy Miller has emerged as the league&#8217;s best tight end, but I&#8217;ll probably trade him, because Bernie Joppru is right on his footsteps in all categories, and he&#8217;s a better blocker when the time comes for that.  The Dolphins are 9-0 as well, so our meeting will determine home field for the playoffs, it appears.  My defense has become a juggernaut, second only to Miami&#8217;s in all categories.</p>


	<p>So it kind of looks like things are clicking on all cylinders.  I find out tomorrow whether I get to have a real interview and take the Capital One test.  Here&#8217;s hoping.</p>

I&#8217;ve been nothing but impressed with Richmond so that would be another positive.  I, of course, will let you guys know how it goes as I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why do we think God (or Christ) would care?  Why would he be on the side of Trot Nixon instead of the numerous praying players on the Oakland Athletics?  My own theories (which are far away from being solid enough to write down) would seem to skirt around these issues, and <span class="caps">ESPN</span> deals with this topic every year it seems like.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see it now that Outside the Lines has gone weekly.</p>


	<p>Moving to a less ethereal aspect, why does sport fascinate people?  My father, who would know this kind of thing, says that it&#8217;s one of the few activities that can be traced to prehistoric times.  You would think, in prehistoric times, that they should have been out hunting with their energy.  Doesn&#8217;t it seem like sports must have some kind of value?  Even if it does, however, is it limited to the prehistoric man level of value?  Is the value the feeling of togetherness in being with a team, or feeling like you&#8217;re the best at something so you can get hot chicks?</p>


	<p>If so, how do you explain figure skating?  Yeah, sure, it&#8217;s a sport.</p>


	<p>Is it some kind of fundamental beauty that we appreciate?  It&#8217;s a little late, and I&#8217;m a little pissed off at UT&#8217;s gameplan to beat Auburn tonight (hey, why run the ball at all?) so I&#8217;m not going to get too poetic, but I at least thought I&#8217;d get it down on paper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, my own Madden exploits.  I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to be a Houston Texans fan.  They have made some great personnel decisions and are putting together a team that I really like.  So it was a natural thing to pick them for my franchise in Madden.</p>


	<p>My first campaign ended at 10-6 and a playoff berth after winning my division. Baltimore came into my house and beat me, but I considered it a success.   I royally messed up the off-season, though, so I considered it a good training run.</p>


	<p>A couple of days ago, I finished my second campaign.  This one was 18-1 and a Super Bowl championship.  Stacey Mack was the <span class="caps">MVP</span> of the league with over 2,000 yards and 28 rushing touchdowns.  David Carr, Billy Miller and three lineman went to the Pro Bowl on the offensive end.  Aaron Glenn scored seven defensive touchdowns off interception returns.  He and Marcus Coleman went and started at cornerback.  In the off-season, I signed Warren Sapp.  Sapp a Texan!  Only in Madden.  I haven&#8217;t had this much fun playing Madden since the first one for the Super Nintendo.  The patented Randall Cunningham &#8211; Shotgun &#8211; Hail Mark combined with a bootleg run for 50 or 25 yards depending on if they were playing man or zone.  Now Madden has 3600 plays or so.</p>


	<p>Also, in our new <span class="caps">NFL</span> season, it looks like somebody&#8217;s in owner mode.  How else would you explain Peyton&#8217;s line in the New Orleans game and Jamal&#8217;s line against Cincinnati?  I just put it together&#8212;both graduated from Tennessee.  But the new <span class="caps">NFL</span> seasons looks intriguing.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what things look like in week 8.</p>


	<p>Peyton singlehandedly resurrected <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=83117">my </a> <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=246389">fantasy</a> <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=486421">chances </a> this year.  I lost my first two games, posting some of the worst scores I&#8217;ve ever put up in week one.  I was standing on the verge of 1-3 when Peyton outscored many teams singlehanded.  And of course, I cut Ashley Lelie and Drew Bennet before they could get going.  Stupid me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><font size="+1"><strong>Week One</strong></font>

	<p>On day one, I woke up in my bed with all my stuff still in the apartment, except the stuff I gave away.  By noon, everything was gone.  I waited on the Merry Maids to come help me keep my deposit.  (I ended up netting $20 on that little investment, go me!)  At that point the only thing left to do was hit the road!</p>


	<p>The first stop was Austin, TX.   I unloaded the kitties, who had had a rough day with every thing getting packed up including them.  When I let them out in Furbish&#8217;s empty room, I thought they&#8217;d be OK.  When I came back in later, two of them were in the litter box and the third was wedged between the box and the wall.  I&#8217;ve never seen them so upset.  I let them out to explore Casa Furbish and they repayed me by not peeing on any of his stuff.</p>


	<p>The reason I went a few hours out of my way was that I got to see <a href="http://www.mogwai.co.uk/">Mogwai</a>, probably the one band I could never justify missing.  Hopefully, I&#8217;ll get another chance to see them, but if it was the first and last, I&#8217;d be happy.  It was a very solid performance, and they did about half of my favorites, as well as half their new album.</p>


	<p>The next morning, I got on my way to Jackson, TN, to check in with Ashley Johnson, a friend of mine from Governor&#8217;s School.  When we met, she was Ashley James, meaning I got to meet her husband.  We were both Road Dogs on Wednesday, so we chilled out on Thursday, talked sports, and watched the hurricane hit the East Coast.  I really enjoyed my time there; they&#8217;ve got a great place, and the two of them are a good match.  That made me really happy.  Her job is in the Department of Human Services (think welfare) which isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;d expect from a conservative, but hey, nobody ever said the world made sense all the time.</p>


	<p>I made the 730 miles from Austin to Jackson in ten and a half hours, my best time ever for a trip of that length.  Had to put that in here.</p>


	<p>The next stop was Maryville.  When I first did the blogish thing back during Freshman year, I would put anything up.  These days, there are some things that are just too personal.  Some things might find there way up later, but not now.  The stay was good, and I saw everyone I needed to see, except one.</p>


	<p>The drive to Richmond went fine, and the kitties were glad to be off the road.</p>


<font size="+1"><strong>Week Two</strong></font>

	<p>Richmond rules.  The first thing you notice is that there are trees absolutely everywhere.  I saw more stars last night than I have an in extremely long time.    I wore jeans today, and it sounds like I&#8217;ll need to wear long sleeves by the end of the week.  I saw my breath tonight when I went outside.  I was ready for all these things again, I always liked seasonably cold weather.</p>


	<p>The traffic here appears to be pretty non-existent, which is something I&#8217;m overjoyed with.  I&#8217;ve been driving just a couple of times, and I already feel like I have a feel for the major roads, and that I could get anywhere I needed to.  That took me years in Houston.</p>


	<p>My room has come together quite well.  Mom&#8217;s got big plans for the downstairs, but when it&#8217;s writing on paper, it&#8217;s always tough for me to see.  In a couple of weeks, we&#8217;ll see how that&#8217;s shaping up.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I&#8217;ve got a great room already, so anything else after that will be gravy.</p>


	<p>So there you go.  That&#8217;s pretty much what I wanted to say, and I just wanted to break the ice on this site again.  I&#8217;ve been away too long, and it&#8217;s good to write.</p>


	<p>Peace!</p>
