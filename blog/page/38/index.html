  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whattup kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
F<b>k it black, no time for looking back it&#8217;s done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don&#8217;t your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that&#8217;s when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn&#8217;t listen he be riffin&#8217; while I&#8217;m telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don&#8217;t care, she a snake too
F</b>king with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome&#8217;s niece, on her way home from Jones Beach &#8211; it&#8217;s bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9&#8217;s
at night time there&#8217;s more trife than ever
Whattup with Cormega, did you see &#8216;em, are y&#8217;all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say whassup to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commisary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? one love</p>


	<p>Dear Born, you&#8217;ll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin on
the crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
hold, check out the story yesterday when i was walking
the nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin&#8217; something
word to mother, i heard him fronting
and he be pumping on your block
your man gave him your glock
and now they run together, what up son, whatever
since I&#8217;m on the streets I&#8217;ma put it to a cease
but I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
better chill cause them niggaz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
but maintain when you come home the corner&#8217;s ours
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother&#8217;s buck whylin&#8217; in four maine he wrote me
he might beat his case, &#8216;til he come home I play it low key
so stay civilised, time flies
though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your mum cries
it kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I&#8217;ve even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love</p>


	<p>[Verse Three]
Sometimes I sit back with a buddha sack
mind&#8217;s in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
F<b>k a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week
and hittin nails while I&#8217;m sleepin
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
to relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible
F</b>kin with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
a future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody&#8217;s helpin shorty doo-wop
Rollin two phillies together in the Bridge we called &#8216;em oowops
He said, &#8220;Nas, niggaz could be bustin&#8217; off the roof
so I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce&#8221;
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin&#8217; on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
keeps me blasted he starts talkin mad shit
I had to school him, told him don&#8217;t let niggaz fool him
&#8216;cos when the pistol blows that&#8217;s when a murder be the cool one
Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families f**ked up
could&#8217;ve cought your man, but didn&#8217;t look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
if the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
shorty&#8217;s laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
and told my little man that i&#8217;m a go cyprose
there&#8217;s some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
keep an eye out for jake shorty what
one love</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve technically been self-employed for quite some time now, so I&#8217;m not technically changing employers;  I still appear to be myself.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be spending most of my time contracting with a fellow who runs a <a href="http://www.ideaweavers.com">local IT shop</a> that sells a particular web application to business clients in the area.  To customers, this application is great.  It performs many, many useful tasks.  To a technical person in charge of working with the application, it needs a lot of work!  Since I happen to <strong>be</strong> a technical person, I see my job as making the code tight enough you could bounce a quarter off of it, then getting rich.</p>


	<p>Taking the contract means significantly fewer responsibilities and significantly more pay.  This is always a good trade!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be sticking with my current contract for a few weeks still.  It&#8217;s not in me to leave anyone high and dry, much less someone who&#8217;s paid my salary for months.  The project has been a success, which is kind of amazing in its own right.  I came in on-time and within budget, which apparently <a href="http://www.it-cortex.com/Stat_Failure_Rate.htm">one in ten IT projects do</a>.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t even see what the coming week will bring, but I know it will be alright.  I haven&#8217;t been this excited since Erin was still with me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As fascinating as the word <a href="http://elimidate.warnerbros.com/?frompage=sitemap">ElimiDate</a> is&#8212;being a proper noun (ElimiDate, show), common noun (ElimiDate, the activity of being <strong>on</strong> an ElimiDate <i>proper noun</i>), verb (to ElimiDate a contestant) and interjection (ElimiDate!)&#8212;I lend much more credence to the online dating community, of which I can now pick the winners and losers.</p>


	<p>The winners are <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eHarmony</a> and <a href="http://www.okcupid.com">OK Cupid</a>.  The first is quite expensive, the second is free.  Don&#8217;t ask me why it works this way.  But if you choose to check out OK Cupid, definitely let me know your username so we can play the <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> angle there.  If you are an <a href="http://www.yournewromance.com/extroorintroquiz.html">introvert</a>, then definitely check out eHarmony.  Yes, the commercials with the founder are creepy, but there are decent connections to be made out there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was watching the 2004 World Series of Poker last night, and they had a bio on <a href="http://www.cardplayer.com/poker_tournaments/results.php?event_id=205&#38;writeup=1">Joe Awada</a>, a player born in Lebanon who emigrated here.</p>


	<p>When he got to the states, he didn&#8217;t have any money, and was touring with a circus doing shlep work.  All while he was working there, he practiced juggling.  Eventually, he signed a contract with another circus that got him to Vegas.</p>


	<p>So you think, &#8220;Oh, wow, then he learns how to gamble and makes it big!&#8221;  Not quite.  He ends up being a dealer and then <a href="http://www.dicedealer.com/3-5-7_poker.htm">developing a new style of poker</a>.  Apparently, that gives him the bankroll to then compete and win.</p>


	<p>Unreal!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2003/08/27/review-war-double-bill">as I predicted</a>, they&#8217;re remaking <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feature/themanchuriancandidate.html"The Manchurian Candidate</a>.   Now, a second prediction.  This one will blow blue whale, the largest mammal on earth.</p>


	<p>The central conceit has been changed from Soviet brainwashing to <i>(ready?)</i> <strong>Corporate America</strong> brainwashing.  That&#8217;s right, they don&#8217;t feel they have enough control, so they&#8217;re going to <strong>kill the President</strong>.  How ridiculous!</p>


	<p>At least Denzel could marginally fill in for Frank Sinatra, although watching Frank break out the chop-socky on the Oriental in the orginal was absolutely priceless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past 72 hours have been pretty crazy.  Here&#8217;s the fallout.</p>


<ul>
<li>I was up until about 5:30 AM on Wednesday night making sure that the set of reports that my project generated for its second pilot group were as good as possible.</li>
<li>Thursday afternoon, we find a problem.  I have about six hours to regenerate all the reports, get them printed out, and get them FedExed to Ithaca, NY.  That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell</a> is, for everyone who&#8217;s not Dan.</li>
<li>My A/C adaptor quit working, and my laptop quickly ran out of batteries, so I spent the day driving and calling around Richmond to find a replacement.  Also, my cell phone mysteriously stopped working.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get them out on Thursday, so I spent Friday doing the same thing, with the knowledge that we were all out of chances.</li>
<li>It seems to have worked.  Yesterday went off without too much of a hitch, and now the reports are on the FedEx truck for delivery.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Did you know that FedEx bought Kinko&#8217;s?  Or something along those lines?  Very interesting.  Certainly helped me out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve never really had that much of a problem with keeping the mapping files seperately.  If you&#8217;re making a change to a domain object, I can&#8217;t imagine even a fairly ignorant developer failing to update the mapping file.  Even then, the problem would quickly bubble to the surface for them.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/102.html">this description</a> of the different phases of round-trip development using Hibernate.  I&#8217;m certainly not of the opinion that schema-to-code or mapping-to-code generation are viable in the long term.  While you may have certain objects that are &#8220;value&#8221; objects in your domain, the entire point of OO programming is to encapsulate state <strong>and</strong> behavior in the same place.  Good luck keeping the methods you write intact out in the wild if you&#8217;re automatically generating your domain object code!</p>

<p>And since the mapping-to-schema connection is quite natural, since I&#8217;m not doing anything but <a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/oose/index.html#greenfielddevelopment">green field</a> work, there&#8217;s no question which direction I&#8217;ll be going.  So it all comes down to whether or not XDoclet can do everything that I&#8217;d like in terms of generating a mapping.  While it may be able to, <strong>is it worth learning how?</strong>  You can hand-write Hibernate mapping files easily and exactly to specification.  I just don&#8217;t see that XDoclet is worth it for Hibernate.  I&#8217;m sure <span class="caps">EJB</span> will keep it alive, but I&#8217;m headed back to manual generation of mappings for my next project.</p>
