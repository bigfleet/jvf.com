  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past 72 hours have been pretty crazy.  Here&#8217;s the fallout.</p>


<ul>
<li>I was up until about 5:30 AM on Wednesday night making sure that the set of reports that my project generated for its second pilot group were as good as possible.</li>
<li>Thursday afternoon, we find a problem.  I have about six hours to regenerate all the reports, get them printed out, and get them FedExed to Ithaca, NY.  That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell</a> is, for everyone who&#8217;s not Dan.</li>
<li>My A/C adaptor quit working, and my laptop quickly ran out of batteries, so I spent the day driving and calling around Richmond to find a replacement.  Also, my cell phone mysteriously stopped working.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get them out on Thursday, so I spent Friday doing the same thing, with the knowledge that we were all out of chances.</li>
<li>It seems to have worked.  Yesterday went off without too much of a hitch, and now the reports are on the FedEx truck for delivery.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Did you know that FedEx bought Kinko&#8217;s?  Or something along those lines?  Very interesting.  Certainly helped me out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve never really had that much of a problem with keeping the mapping files seperately.  If you&#8217;re making a change to a domain object, I can&#8217;t imagine even a fairly ignorant developer failing to update the mapping file.  Even then, the problem would quickly bubble to the surface for them.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/102.html">this description</a> of the different phases of round-trip development using Hibernate.  I&#8217;m certainly not of the opinion that schema-to-code or mapping-to-code generation are viable in the long term.  While you may have certain objects that are &#8220;value&#8221; objects in your domain, the entire point of OO programming is to encapsulate state <strong>and</strong> behavior in the same place.  Good luck keeping the methods you write intact out in the wild if you&#8217;re automatically generating your domain object code!</p>

<p>And since the mapping-to-schema connection is quite natural, since I&#8217;m not doing anything but <a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/oose/index.html#greenfielddevelopment">green field</a> work, there&#8217;s no question which direction I&#8217;ll be going.  So it all comes down to whether or not XDoclet can do everything that I&#8217;d like in terms of generating a mapping.  While it may be able to, <strong>is it worth learning how?</strong>  You can hand-write Hibernate mapping files easily and exactly to specification.  I just don&#8217;t see that XDoclet is worth it for Hibernate.  I&#8217;m sure <span class="caps">EJB</span> will keep it alive, but I&#8217;m headed back to manual generation of mappings for my next project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been quite busy with the actual product I&#8217;ve put out.  Since I last posted (in no particular order)&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>The site has seen its two pilot groups debut almost without a hitch.</li>
<li>During development, I was assuming that we would have a potential concurrent user base in the hundreds.  It now is clear that the number is in the thousands.  This has led to a large amount of hard work for me that I don&#8217;t enjoy in a short amount of time.</li>
<li>The needs of the project in general are now larger than I can assuredly handle.  I&#8217;ve had to accept this and just be thankful that I still have a job each morning.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been offered a new job in principle.  The fellow who offered it to me will be back this week to discuss specifics.  Think: more pay, less work.</li>
<li>My current boss is in town this week to discuss where we are right now, and where we can be in the future.  Timing with above is intriguing.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve learned it is a possibility that the project could fail and it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be my fault;  one needs an entire team of non-developers for the project to be a success.  One good developer isn&#8217;t enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to post more in the near future, but who knows what tomorrow brings?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, I&#8217;m still kicking it.</p>


	<p>The move is over, more or less.  I now live in <a href="http://www.fandistrict.org/">The Fan</a> in Richmond, VA.  It&#8217;s really very nice.  There&#8217;s folks of all ages, but everybody&#8217;s personable.  I live less then two blocks from three different restaurants, all of them good.  All of them are also bars.  It&#8217;s that kind of place.</p>


	<p>I live in a very old house, it&#8217;ll be 100 next year.  That has its own quirks, but mostly it&#8217;s a nice change of pace from the sterile Brompton Court apartments.  I am the closest to a laundry room I&#8217;ve ever been.  No dishwasher, though.  With the amount of cooking I do, however, that&#8217;s not a huge sacrifice.</p>


	<p>My project has been running for almost a week with no real hiccups.  That&#8217;s pretty gratifying.</p>


	<p>My friendship with Elizabeth is turning into something a little new for me, not that it&#8217;s any of your business.  ;-)</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting ready to visit Brady this weekend down in South Carolina.  That&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun.</p>


	<p>Mostly, I&#8217;m hoping to start writing more frequently.  Not the first time you&#8217;ve heard me say that, though, right?</p>

<p>The central idea of the presentation was called the &#8220;Web Application Test Sandwich&#8221;.  It looks something like what you&#8217;ll see on the right.  The idea was to present the type of testing each product can perform, and which products compete with and compliment each other in which ways.  It was an excellent primer to have the lightning bolt hit during Dave Thomas&#8217; <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000036.html">Mock Objects</a> talk right afterwards.</p>

<h2>JUnit</h2>

<p>First we talked about JUnit, where I didn&#8217;t really learn anything new.  If you don&#8217;t know about JUnit, Rick&#8217;s recommendation is Kent Beck&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321146530/jimvanfleetco-20?creative=125581&#38;camp=2321&#38;link_code=as1">Test Driven Development By Example</a>.</p>

<h2>DBUnit</h2>

<p>Next up was DBUnit, a product I will definitely be adding to my toolkit.  DBUnit is designed to be a unit testing tool for <strong>using</strong> databases.  As you might imagine, it handles some very interesting cases gracefully.  You can use <span class="caps">XML</span> files to describe a pre-populated universe for your domain.  You can write these yourself or have DBUnit take an <span class="caps">XML</span> snapshot of a currently existing DB.  You can also just use the test database itself, if you&#8217;d rather avoid <span class="caps">XML</span> altogether.  The flexibility is appreciated.</p>

<p>My Spring+Hibernate experience has moved me towards appreciation of the <span class="caps">DAO</span>, which is an extremely easy pattern to test using DBUnit.  In addition, to speed the running of unit tests, DBUnit can supply an ant command to prepare a test dataset for use during your unit tests.  This way, the <span class="inlineCode"><span class="caps">INSERT</span></span> operations only happen once.</p>

<p>In terms of operations, DBUnit acts much as you&#8217;d expect.  It&#8217;s a thin extension of JUnit;  you have to have your test cases extend a new base class, but most everything else behaves the same.</p>

<h2>Cactus</h2>

<p>I went into the presentation not entirely sure of Cactus&#8217;s role in unit testing.  It seemed so complicated to set up, how could it possibly be a unit test?  Semantic quibbling aside, Cactus can be invaluable for certain projects, but I feel that I don&#8217;t need to use it.</p>

<h4>Why use Cactus?</h4>

<p>I would recommend that a project use Cactus if it depends heavily on it&#8217;s <span class="caps">J2EE</span> environs.  <span class="caps">JNDI</span> lookups, interoperations with <span class="inlineCode">ServletContext</span>, <span class="inlineCode">HttpServletRequest</span>, and <span class="inlineCode">HttpSession</span> objects, or whatever other features you might be using from your application server.  These elements are frequently difficult or impossible to mock, much less provide correct behavior for outside of the real, running environment.  You would know better than me if your project fits the bill.</p>

<p>In my case, the Mock Objects approach is superior.  I can mock certain elements in the Sofia framework, and provide a mock controller in addition to a real controller.  Spring can configure the behavioral testing phase of my mock controller at runtime, and all the actual business code is in the abstract superclass that the controllers share.  Sofia is mature enough that I&#8217;m satisfied that it will behave correctly in nearly all circumstances.  As a result, I focus on whether my code is interacting with the Sofia constructs appropriately.  I don&#8217;t need Tomcat running to interact with any persistence layer;  both memory-based and <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-based persistence layers will run fine without it, thanks to Spring.<p>

<h2>StrutsTestCase</h2>

<p>No comment, though it looks nice for the Struts users.  Obviously, you would have had to work with Struts to know <strong>how</strong> nice.</p>

<h2>HttpUnit</h2>

<p>HttpUnit is the functional testing slice of the sandwich, the top piece of bread.  HttpUnit and its extension JWebUnit act as modified web browsers that you can command via the Java language.  They both contain advanced capabilities in terms of parsing the responses and providing you with access to the data that has fulfilled your request.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t live in a world where functional testing is going to be fully replaced by a machine.  My clients are going to want to pound the keys themselves.  As a result, I don&#8217;t know exactly how much time I want to spend testing on this level.  Customers are so picky about their <span class="caps">GUI</span>, sometimes in completely braindead ways.  I don&#8217;t want to be even more frustrated because I have to go back and change a nifty test implementation for something I don&#8217;t even like in the first place.  But what does that have to do with HttpUnit?  :-)</p>

<p>In terms of technology, I&#8217;d likely evaluate both HttpUnit and JWebUnit.  The latter is an extension of the former, although apparently it is not a superset.  Rumor has it that there are some advanced features of HttpUnit that are not present in JWebUnit.  So, when it comes time, I&#8217;ll evaluate further.  The technology at this level, however, will play a role.  Its size is yet to be determined.</p>

<h2>The Presenter</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember which blog I saw that gassed Rick, I think maybe it was Ted Neward&#8217;s, but he wasn&#8217;t wrong.  Rick obviously has a large body of knowledge, and he claims that his group&#8217;s specialty is &#8220;saving your project&#8217;s ass,&#8221; so he&#8217;s got to be ready to put his fees where his mouth is on that score.  Rick continued the high level of speaker quality, in my opinion.</p>

I know <span class="caps">EJB</span> is not going to fit with the projects I do in the near future.  When the time comes to fully undertake an <span class="caps">EJB</span> project, I&#8217;ll need to see real code before these background talks are really useful&#8212;I already know <span class="caps">EJB</span> is very complicated.</p>


	<p>He followed with a discussion of <span class="caps">JDO</span>.  This discussion raised a philosophical question for me that I really can&#8217;t evaluate at this time.  I&#8217;ll pose it to you.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">JDO</span> is a spec.  That means when you talk about <span class="caps">JDO</span>, you&#8217;re not talking about a product, you&#8217;re talking about a kind of tool that you&#8217;d like to use.  To this end, <span class="caps">JDO</span> is a generic persistence spec.  The persistent space could be a flat file, <span class="caps">XML</span>, OODBMS, or <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>&#8212;or probably even memory, we didn&#8217;t discuss that.</p>


	<p>As an agile practitioner, this sounds great!  I&#8217;d love to be able to develop client and test code that would not change when it&#8217;s time to change the persistent store configuration from memory to <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>.  Make the change, run the unit tests, and wham, you&#8217;ve taken a gigantic step towards deployment.  As a user, I&#8217;d wonder, &#8220;But what on earth are they going to do about the query language?  Surely you can&#8217;t query an <span class="caps">XML</span> file the same way that you can query a database?&#8221;  Turns out this is only partly true, but the query language differences do lead to complications.  As a project manager, I say &#8220;OK, sounds nice.  But why do we actually <strong>need</strong> this?  And wait, it costs $600 for each developer to code with?  Why not just code your own memory persistence layer (2 minute hashtable) if you need one, put it behind a factory/interface, and save us some money?&#8221;</p>


	<p>Is there sometimes a conflict between &#8220;potential&#8221; agility and need?  If agility is the ability to respond to problems quickly, is it possible to extend a measure of agility into the future?</p>


	<p>At any rate, this particular manifestation of the issue is moot.  As long as <span class="caps">JDO</span> remains at 1.x, no way am I spending money on an implementation when I&#8217;m &#8220;vested&#8221; in Hibernate.  Hibernate came out well in the comparison, although many are concerned about its youth, support, and lack of proven track record.  Note that I&#8217;m just parroting, I have no idea what Hibernate&#8217;s track record is.  It certainly seems to me like if you paid for support, that&#8217;d be all that was necessary.  Paying for support of a free product has always seemed extremely reasonable to me.  Also, in my experience, the free support community for Hibernate is actually quite good.</p>


	<p>In the end, Bruce looked to the future with <span class="caps">EJB 3</span> and <span class="caps">JDO 2</span>.  He&#8217;s doing a good enough job keeping his thoughts on this in public, so I won&#8217;t go into them here.  But remember, those specs aren&#8217;t even out, and they will take time to implement&#8212;time which I certainly don&#8217;t have, I need to be growing.</p>


	<p>My marks for Bruce were excellent.  He is a very effective group speaker, surprisingly so for a code monkey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a title="LinuxQuestions.org - USB Keyboard: I need to load USB at startup time. - where Linux users come for help" href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&#38;threadid=197365&#38;highlight=usb keyboard">this post</a> about <span class="caps">USB</span> support in Linux, I&#8217;m now running two boxes in my office.  One is Windows XP, the other is now a Debian Linux installation.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve added the second box to help practice some of my build techniques without having to have the real remote server down.  Plus, it&#8217;s extra geek points!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got some <span class="caps">NFJS</span> reviews in the can.  Look for them to be up in the next couple of days.  Right now I&#8217;m doing some customer support.</p>
