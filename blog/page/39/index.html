  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, I&#8217;m still kicking it.</p>


	<p>The move is over, more or less.  I now live in <a href="http://www.fandistrict.org/">The Fan</a> in Richmond, VA.  It&#8217;s really very nice.  There&#8217;s folks of all ages, but everybody&#8217;s personable.  I live less then two blocks from three different restaurants, all of them good.  All of them are also bars.  It&#8217;s that kind of place.</p>


	<p>I live in a very old house, it&#8217;ll be 100 next year.  That has its own quirks, but mostly it&#8217;s a nice change of pace from the sterile Brompton Court apartments.  I am the closest to a laundry room I&#8217;ve ever been.  No dishwasher, though.  With the amount of cooking I do, however, that&#8217;s not a huge sacrifice.</p>


	<p>My project has been running for almost a week with no real hiccups.  That&#8217;s pretty gratifying.</p>


	<p>My friendship with Elizabeth is turning into something a little new for me, not that it&#8217;s any of your business.  ;-)</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting ready to visit Brady this weekend down in South Carolina.  That&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun.</p>


	<p>Mostly, I&#8217;m hoping to start writing more frequently.  Not the first time you&#8217;ve heard me say that, though, right?</p>

<p>The central idea of the presentation was called the &#8220;Web Application Test Sandwich&#8221;.  It looks something like what you&#8217;ll see on the right.  The idea was to present the type of testing each product can perform, and which products compete with and compliment each other in which ways.  It was an excellent primer to have the lightning bolt hit during Dave Thomas&#8217; <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000036.html">Mock Objects</a> talk right afterwards.</p>

<h2>JUnit</h2>

<p>First we talked about JUnit, where I didn&#8217;t really learn anything new.  If you don&#8217;t know about JUnit, Rick&#8217;s recommendation is Kent Beck&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321146530/jimvanfleetco-20?creative=125581&#38;camp=2321&#38;link_code=as1">Test Driven Development By Example</a>.</p>

<h2>DBUnit</h2>

<p>Next up was DBUnit, a product I will definitely be adding to my toolkit.  DBUnit is designed to be a unit testing tool for <strong>using</strong> databases.  As you might imagine, it handles some very interesting cases gracefully.  You can use <span class="caps">XML</span> files to describe a pre-populated universe for your domain.  You can write these yourself or have DBUnit take an <span class="caps">XML</span> snapshot of a currently existing DB.  You can also just use the test database itself, if you&#8217;d rather avoid <span class="caps">XML</span> altogether.  The flexibility is appreciated.</p>

<p>My Spring+Hibernate experience has moved me towards appreciation of the <span class="caps">DAO</span>, which is an extremely easy pattern to test using DBUnit.  In addition, to speed the running of unit tests, DBUnit can supply an ant command to prepare a test dataset for use during your unit tests.  This way, the <span class="inlineCode"><span class="caps">INSERT</span></span> operations only happen once.</p>

<p>In terms of operations, DBUnit acts much as you&#8217;d expect.  It&#8217;s a thin extension of JUnit;  you have to have your test cases extend a new base class, but most everything else behaves the same.</p>

<h2>Cactus</h2>

<p>I went into the presentation not entirely sure of Cactus&#8217;s role in unit testing.  It seemed so complicated to set up, how could it possibly be a unit test?  Semantic quibbling aside, Cactus can be invaluable for certain projects, but I feel that I don&#8217;t need to use it.</p>

<h4>Why use Cactus?</h4>

<p>I would recommend that a project use Cactus if it depends heavily on it&#8217;s <span class="caps">J2EE</span> environs.  <span class="caps">JNDI</span> lookups, interoperations with <span class="inlineCode">ServletContext</span>, <span class="inlineCode">HttpServletRequest</span>, and <span class="inlineCode">HttpSession</span> objects, or whatever other features you might be using from your application server.  These elements are frequently difficult or impossible to mock, much less provide correct behavior for outside of the real, running environment.  You would know better than me if your project fits the bill.</p>

<p>In my case, the Mock Objects approach is superior.  I can mock certain elements in the Sofia framework, and provide a mock controller in addition to a real controller.  Spring can configure the behavioral testing phase of my mock controller at runtime, and all the actual business code is in the abstract superclass that the controllers share.  Sofia is mature enough that I&#8217;m satisfied that it will behave correctly in nearly all circumstances.  As a result, I focus on whether my code is interacting with the Sofia constructs appropriately.  I don&#8217;t need Tomcat running to interact with any persistence layer;  both memory-based and <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-based persistence layers will run fine without it, thanks to Spring.<p>

<h2>StrutsTestCase</h2>

<p>No comment, though it looks nice for the Struts users.  Obviously, you would have had to work with Struts to know <strong>how</strong> nice.</p>

<h2>HttpUnit</h2>

<p>HttpUnit is the functional testing slice of the sandwich, the top piece of bread.  HttpUnit and its extension JWebUnit act as modified web browsers that you can command via the Java language.  They both contain advanced capabilities in terms of parsing the responses and providing you with access to the data that has fulfilled your request.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t live in a world where functional testing is going to be fully replaced by a machine.  My clients are going to want to pound the keys themselves.  As a result, I don&#8217;t know exactly how much time I want to spend testing on this level.  Customers are so picky about their <span class="caps">GUI</span>, sometimes in completely braindead ways.  I don&#8217;t want to be even more frustrated because I have to go back and change a nifty test implementation for something I don&#8217;t even like in the first place.  But what does that have to do with HttpUnit?  :-)</p>

<p>In terms of technology, I&#8217;d likely evaluate both HttpUnit and JWebUnit.  The latter is an extension of the former, although apparently it is not a superset.  Rumor has it that there are some advanced features of HttpUnit that are not present in JWebUnit.  So, when it comes time, I&#8217;ll evaluate further.  The technology at this level, however, will play a role.  Its size is yet to be determined.</p>

<h2>The Presenter</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember which blog I saw that gassed Rick, I think maybe it was Ted Neward&#8217;s, but he wasn&#8217;t wrong.  Rick obviously has a large body of knowledge, and he claims that his group&#8217;s specialty is &#8220;saving your project&#8217;s ass,&#8221; so he&#8217;s got to be ready to put his fees where his mouth is on that score.  Rick continued the high level of speaker quality, in my opinion.</p>

<time datetime="2004-06-27T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 27<span>th</span>, 2004</time> - 
        


        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We started with <span class="caps">EJB</span>.  I listened to this essentially out of curiousity.  I know <span class="caps">EJB</span> is not going to fit with the projects I do in the near future.  When the time comes to fully undertake an <span class="caps">EJB</span> project, I&#8217;ll need to see real code before these background talks are really useful&#8212;I already know <span class="caps">EJB</span> is very complicated.</p>


	<p>He followed with a discussion of <span class="caps">JDO</span>.  This discussion raised a philosophical question for me that I really can&#8217;t evaluate at this time.  I&#8217;ll pose it to you.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">JDO</span> is a spec.  That means when you talk about <span class="caps">JDO</span>, you&#8217;re not talking about a product, you&#8217;re talking about a kind of tool that you&#8217;d like to use.  To this end, <span class="caps">JDO</span> is a generic persistence spec.  The persistent space could be a flat file, <span class="caps">XML</span>, OODBMS, or <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>&#8212;or probably even memory, we didn&#8217;t discuss that.</p>


	<p>As an agile practitioner, this sounds great!  I&#8217;d love to be able to develop client and test code that would not change when it&#8217;s time to change the persistent store configuration from memory to <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>.  Make the change, run the unit tests, and wham, you&#8217;ve taken a gigantic step towards deployment.  As a user, I&#8217;d wonder, &#8220;But what on earth are they going to do about the query language?  Surely you can&#8217;t query an <span class="caps">XML</span> file the same way that you can query a database?&#8221;  Turns out this is only partly true, but the query language differences do lead to complications.  As a project manager, I say &#8220;OK, sounds nice.  But why do we actually <strong>need</strong> this?  And wait, it costs $600 for each developer to code with?  Why not just code your own memory persistence layer (2 minute hashtable) if you need one, put it behind a factory/interface, and save us some money?&#8221;</p>


	<p>Is there sometimes a conflict between &#8220;potential&#8221; agility and need?  If agility is the ability to respond to problems quickly, is it possible to extend a measure of agility into the future?</p>


	<p>At any rate, this particular manifestation of the issue is moot.  As long as <span class="caps">JDO</span> remains at 1.x, no way am I spending money on an implementation when I&#8217;m &#8220;vested&#8221; in Hibernate.  Hibernate came out well in the comparison, although many are concerned about its youth, support, and lack of proven track record.  Note that I&#8217;m just parroting, I have no idea what Hibernate&#8217;s track record is.  It certainly seems to me like if you paid for support, that&#8217;d be all that was necessary.  Paying for support of a free product has always seemed extremely reasonable to me.  Also, in my experience, the free support community for Hibernate is actually quite good.</p>


	<p>In the end, Bruce looked to the future with <span class="caps">EJB 3</span> and <span class="caps">JDO 2</span>.  He&#8217;s doing a good enough job keeping his thoughts on this in public, so I won&#8217;t go into them here.  But remember, those specs aren&#8217;t even out, and they will take time to implement&#8212;time which I certainly don&#8217;t have, I need to be growing.</p>


	<p>My marks for Bruce were excellent.  He is a very effective group speaker, surprisingly so for a code monkey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The project is undergoing its first customer demo as we speak.  It&#8217;s in Great Britian, which means I&#8217;m up at 4 in the morning!  I&#8217;m getting bored sitting here waiting for a problem, and I&#8217;m certainly not up for any taxing mental activity.</p>


	<p>As for what I&#8217;m working on these days, it&#8217;s an introduction to <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> using some techniques and tools from other popular open source projects.  It will also include a framework for unit testing a <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> application thoroughly.  It&#8217;s coming together pretty well, so far.  It appears that I may have to put it on the shelf for another week or so to handle some customer requests, but that&#8217;s the price we pay&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I plan on using Naked Objects for rapid prototyping.  Now that I know how to produce a &#8220;working&#8221; domain model using the framework, I feel that it will be an excellent tool that I actually will use on my next project.  I am <strong>not</strong> going to use Naked Objects in the delivered product.  These notes are geared towards developers who have similar plans.</p>

<h2>The Interface Is The Output</h2>

<p>First, do <strong>not</strong> write your business object interfaces first.  It may seem natural to do so, then grow the interface and the Naked Object implementation together.  That&#8217;s what I actually did.  What a pain!</p>

<p>The rub is that the Naked Objects framework actually uses wrappers around Strings, floats, ints, and the Collections interface.  While implementing the interface is trivial for the primitive wrappers, it&#8217;s not immediately apparent how to implement the methods that would return a <span class="inlineCode">List</span>, for example.  Since the point is rapid prototyping, just start with the basics.  We&#8217;re going to throw this code away, essentially, so why spend time poking in innards?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also in a period where we expect frequent, massive change to the domain model.  Without implementing the interface, you can aspire to real-time edits and allowing the business customer to see the effects their changes have on the model.  If you treat the interface to the business objects as the output, you get all the benefits of Naked Objects without sacrificing anything truly worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The documentation is in an interesting state.  First, the tutorial serves as an excellent walkthrough.  There was no information I needed that wasn&#8217;t in the original package, <strong>except</strong> for the fact that you no longer need the two separate icons.</li>
<li>While the wrapping of values and collections seems a little odd, I consider it an extremely small price to pay to get that UI up and running.</li>
<li>It&#8217;d be interesting to see a more involved system than the one I produced.  Mostly, I&#8217;m just fascinated by the concept that this framework could be used directly in a deliverable.  Can users really do it?  Can it possibly be for everyone?</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is Spring all about?</h2>

<p>Spring is commonly described as an Inversion of Control (IOC) or dependency injection container.  While I understand what the terms mean, I have the <del>- what would Dave Thomas call it? -</del> novice reaction of.. &#8220;So?&#8221;</p>

<p>To say Spring does only one thing would be a great injustice.  But I have to start in one place, and that&#8217;s getting <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and Spring tied together.  To do this, a perusal of the documentation and the sample application makes it clear that I&#8217;m going to need to work with an <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span>. <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span> is a subclass of <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span>, and here&#8217;s what the Spring reference manual says that a <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> does:</p>

<blockquote>
The <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility.
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of questions I had before my evaluation that were based on this claim, and how Spring ended up.</p>

<dl>
<dt><p>Q. Can it give me access to many different Hibernate <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> objects at runtime?   Because heaven forbid my bosses would sell an entirely separate version of the application to a client&#8230;</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. Absolutely.  This actually couldn&#8217;t be easier.</p></dd>
<dt><p>Q. What about alternate configurations of the same <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span>?  For example, I need my <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> pointing at a different database in a production environment than where it points during a developmental one.</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. Yes, this is possible.  It&#8217;s equally as involved as the techniques I&#8217;m using with <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> do perform this same task right now, you just have to put the output into a new file.  For my own personal implementation, it will actually reduce the number of files I&#8217;m having to manage, but I need to do some subtle things with my Spring configuration files first.</p></dd>
<dt><p>Q. What about my actual beans?  Certianly my <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> is a bean.  What about my <span class="caps">POJO</span>&#8217;s?  Do I have to re-do my Hibernate mappings in Spring format?  The sample application would seem to indicate that I do not, but is that just because it&#8217;s a lightweight sample?</p></dt>
<dd><p>A. You can use Spring to configure whatever it is that you want.  You probably shouldn&#8217;t redo your Hibernate mapping files inside, but if you want some pre-fab instantiations of some Hibernate objects, Spring would be the way to go.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2>OK, So What&#8217;s A Bean?</h2>

<h4>From the reference:</h4>

<blockquote>
The <span class="inlineCode">BeanFactory</span> isn&#8217;t limited to just managing beans, it is also able to manage virtually any class you want it to manage. [&#8230;] (I)t&#8217;s possible to have more exotic non-bean-style classes in your BeanFactory.
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, clear your mind of what &#8220;bean&#8221; means in whatever context you are familiar with.  &#8220;Bean&#8221; means any Java class, really.  If you&#8217;re clever enough, you can use Spring to set up nearly any object you&#8217;re interested in.  Bean definitions require an implementation class, which is natural enough.  One more reason to <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000008.html">program to interfaces</a> if you plan on using Spring.  Then, you can let it do the dirty work of carrying the right implementation to your classes!</p>

<p>You can describe the methods that need to be called on initialization and destruction of a bean, which is very nice.  I can think of a few contexts where that might be useful.</p>

<p>Spring beans can depend on other Spring beans, a concept that will be illustrated in the next Spring post, where you see how to get your hands dirty.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>At this point in my evaluation process, Spring does two things.  First, it configures <span class="inlineCode">SessionFactory</span> objects very nicely.  I don&#8217;t have to write any ThreadLocal classes, or re-write the same code over and over when I want to use the same code with different input in different contexts (e.g. inside the container, outside the container, local database, remote database).  Second, it will manage the <span class="inlineCode">Session</span> objects so I don&#8217;t have to.  I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye out to make sure that this is actually working in a way I understand;  as a developer, try not to rely on technologies you don&#8217;t understand on some level.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, make it four!  I get transaction management and second level caching <strong>for free</strong>.  I&#8217;m not kidding.  Setting up Hibernate&#8217;s transaction manager is an extra three lines of <span class="caps">XML</span>, and setting up the cache means copying a <span class="caps">JAR</span> file.  Spring actually complained when I left out the <span class="caps">JAR</span> that enabled the caching ability.</p>

<p>These two&#8212;er, four&#8212; areas make a big win for me.  Also, now I&#8217;m in a boat with other people who will be working on the finer points for me, so I can focus on <strong>getting my work done</strong>.  Using open source products puts you on a team, for better or worse.  I love teams, so for me, it&#8217;s better.  Spring does many other things, as well, so they&#8217;re ready when I am.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m still wondering how on Earth Spring is going to handle <span class="inlineCode">Session</span> management without knowing about <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/salmon"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a>!  The <span class="inlineCode">WebApplicationContext</span> seems like where that magic might happen.  Spring is set up and working, however, after about three days of looking at it and working on it off and on.  If I do need to understand more about <span class="inlineCode">ApplicationContext</span>s to get exactly the behavior I&#8217;m looking for, that&#8217;s quite all right with me.  I&#8217;ll share whatever I learn here!</p>

<p>Maybe I was too hard on <span class="caps">DAO</span> <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000011.html">here</a>.  The <span class="inlineCode">HibernateClinic</span> class which extends Spring&#8217;s <span class="inlineCode">HibernateDaoSupport</span> looks exactly like a class I&#8217;ve already written to provide many of the same features.  If I had <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000008.html">written to an interface</a> in the first place, it would be trivial to plug in Spring behind the scenes&#8230; for that class, anyway!</p>

<p>A question for the future, since no one actually reads this yet.</p>

<p>Inside the sample petclinic <span class="inlineCode">HibernateClinic</span> class, this is about as complex as the code gets:</p>

<pre class="code">
public List findOwners(String lastName) throws DataAccessException {
    return getHibernateTemplate().find("from Owner owner where owner.lastName like ?", lastName + "%");
}
</pre>

<p>What about something more complicated?  Do your most complicated queries belong in the <span class="caps">DAO</span> class/usage pattern?  <span class="caps">DAO</span> seems to only slightly modify <span class="caps">CRUD</span>.  Where&#8217;s the beef?  For now, my persistence service is going to extend <span class="inlineCode">HibernateDaoSupport</span>, but will include all the complicated queries.</p>
