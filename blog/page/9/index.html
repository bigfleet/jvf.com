  <div class="entry-content">Hello, again, all!  As <a href="/2007/8/10/an-update-by-being-tagged-was-8-habits-facts">my last update post</a> may have led you to believe, I have indeed been monstrously busy over the past several months.  It happens to the best of us.

Recently, however, I’ve managed to carve out enough time to do something that I’ve wanted to do for several years.  The website that you are now reading not only has <a href="http://www.someguysblog.com/">a snappy new domain</a> but also the same software runs a site for my main domain at <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/">jimvanfleet.com</a>.  This is the first time that software of <strong>any</strong> kind has run my main domain, so, for a geek like me, that’s pretty neat.

My belief is that this setup will allow me to lay out my thoughts and interests with structure (which blogs don’t really do) while still using the blog format (which is the best for keeping people up to date and retaining interest).  I’m getting to a point in my professional life where I expect to have to spend more time blogging to have the success that I’d like.  What a world, huh?

So welcome!  I know this is the first that you’ve heard from me in awhile, but I catch a flight to Iowa later today.  <span class="caps">IOWA</span>!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ezra&#8217;s Merb presentation was useful for someone like me with no exposure to the framework, but could have been sexier.  Where&#8217;s our 10 minute blog app?</p>


	<p>Adhearsion looks like it might make <span class="caps">VOIP</span> accessible to me, which is a pretty ridiculous notion.  If you&#8217;re thinking <span class="caps">VOIP</span> and Ruby, think Adhearsion.  I know the speaker is probably frustrated that his demo didn&#8217;t come off at the end, but that was going to be incredible if he pulled it off.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve heard Bruce Tate speak a number of times, but it&#8217;s clear to me that getting out of the Java sphere has actually been good for his psyche.  He speaks with a lot more passion now and asks interesting questions.  He&#8217;s not the only one asking them, but I think it&#8217;s pretty likely that some of my fellow attendees could really get something out of reflecting on his talk.</p>


	<p>Our social schedule led to missing the games development talk.  Ooops!</p>


	<p>The lightning round was relatively informative, and I preferred it to what I saw during the security talk at RailsConf.</p>


	<p>The birds of a feather session that I attended about using Rails for social good included discussion of a mailing list that I hope ends up happening.</p>


	<p>The presenters on the second day after that all did a great job.  Ken Ault gave a great talk about the Rails ecosystem and how the interrelations were important for Smalltalk and what Ruby can learn.  Smalltalk got a lot of &#8220;face-time&#8221; this weekend.</p>


	<p>Jared Richardson gave a really illuminating talk on the interrelationship between C and Ruby.</p>


	<p>Both talks I&#8217;m going to watch again at some point, and I think that&#8217;s one of the highest compliments I can pay.</p>


	<p>Marcel Molina wrapped up with a talk on beauty which really wasn&#8217;t to my tastes, although clearly many people in the crowd responded well to it.</p>


	<p>Overall, I think the organizers and the presenters did an incredible job of getting a lineup of interesting speakers and topics together in a place, delivering a great value, and bringing it off almost without a hitch.  Awesome job, and I give my compliments to everyone involved.</p>

<time datetime="2007-08-10T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 10<span>th</span>, 2007</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">OS X</span> on my new MacBook Pro for some time now, and I&#8217;m elated with it.  I have used <span class="caps">OS X</span> before, at Rice.  At that time, it was the only computer that I could do everything I would ever need to do from.  I&#8217;m over that, this time around.  I needed to be able to do even more, and <span class="caps">OS X</span> did not let me down.  I have had to pay a lot for software this time around, but we&#8217;ll get into that in a later post.</p>


	<h2>What I Run</h2>


	<h3>Web Browsing (and <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet">del.icio.us</a>) posting</h3>


	<p><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> and <a href="http://protagonist.co.uk/dashLicious/">dashLicious</a> are my preferred combo here, although I do run Firefox right now for GMail.  I may try out BonEcho, but my computer hasn&#8217;t shied under the load so far, so running two browsers is OK by me.  Camino delivers a Firefox level of browsing quality almost always, and pairs perfectly with dashLicious, which is kind enough to be browser agnostic.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a></h3>


	<p>Quicksilver is the majordomo for <span class="caps">OS X</span>.  &#8220;Albert, open my newsreader!&#8221;, &#8220;Albert, send this file over IM to my friend <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net">Jeremy</a>!&#8221;  Quicksilver has most of its functionality tied to Apple software, but plugins are available.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploadr</a></h3>


	<p>I use <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for my photosharing needs, and you can view the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigfleet">bigfleet photostream</a> to check it out yourself.  The tools are so much better than uploading directly using the web interface, it&#8217;s kind of a joke that I ever used the web in the first place.</p>


	<p>If you use Flickr, this tool is a must download.</p>


	<h3>Google Notifier and GMail Macros</h3>


	<p>The whole reason that I run two browsers is that the combination of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> and <a href="http://blog.persistent.info/2005/12/greasemonkey-christmas.html">GMail Macros</a> is so powerful.  The real inspiration for this post is that I have finally reached an empty inbox on GMail after clearing out nearly 2600 unread messages.  You can fly through tagging, archiving, and deleting messages with barely any time at all.  It really facilitates the sort of session that is advocated in Getting Things Done.</p>


	<p><a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html">Google Notifier</a> does the job of letting me know when I have new mail.  It also lets me know if I have just read a piece of mail (by displaying a &#8220;new&#8221; entry in the ten newest unread messages list) which is annoying but still worth it.</p>


	<h3>Handbrake, iSquint and Lostify</h3>


	<p>Just <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?p=305">read this</a> if you have an iPod.</p>


	<h3>NeoOffice</h3>


	<p>Even if <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a> is slow to start up, you can&#8217;t beat free.  Maybe the new iWork releases are awesome, though, and they&#8217;ll be worth paying for.</p>


	<h3>SSHKeychain</h3>


	<p>If you use <span class="caps">SSH</span> a lot, you can use <a href="http://scoops.totallyrule.com/articles/2005/10/25/sshkeychain">SSHKeychain</a> to stop typing your passwords.  If you&#8217;re like me, that actually makes a big difference.</p>


	<h3>Adium</h3>


	<p>Although I really wish that either <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> would work with Quicksilver or Yahoo would work with iChat, since neither of those seems to be imminent, it&#8217;s Adium for me.  Although I did get laid off, so I&#8217;m not really required to use Yahoo! IM anymore, so the iChat door is open again.</p>


	<h3>CocoaMySQL</h3>


	<p>MySQL is my favored database, and <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/index.html">CocoaMySQL</a> is my favorite interface to it on <span class="caps">OS X</span>.</p>


	<h3>Transmission</h3>


	<p>For BitTorrent on the Mac, my favorite application is <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a> although <a href="http://www.bitrocket.org/">BitRocket</a> shows a lot of promise.</p>


	<h3>Colloquy</h3>


	<p><span class="caps">IRC</span> is taken care of by <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>.  It&#8217;s the best <span class="caps">IRC</span> client that I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>


	<p>Have fun with this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/mattwaltersnet/~3/137629528/">Matt</a> tagged me, and this seems like a decent enough way to catch everyone up with the basics of what&#8217;s going on at this extremely busy time in my life.</p>


	<p>&#8220;list eight habits or facts about yourself, then tag eight more people.&#8221;</p>


<ol>
<li>I am not going to finish up writing RailsConf 2007 like I said that I would.  I blame my readers for their utter lack of caring.  It&#8217;s just too far in the rear-view mirror now.  Next year, I&#8217;ll move more quickly.</li>
<li>I left on a trip for Europe on July 16 and returned on July 30.  It was an incredible trip, undoubtedly one I will remember for a long time.  The trip was with 10 high-school children from King William county where Megan taught this year.  I&#8217;m certainly going to try to blog about this.</li>
<li>The time between RailsConf and Europe was spent primarily on <span class="caps">XSLT</span> project with a Flash front-end.  That was different.</li>
<li>Two days after I came back to work, I was laid off by my employer.  It was four days before my ten-year high school reunion, and just over two weeks before <strong>The Big Day</strong>.  I&#8217;m interviewing with several places around the country, and having an enjoyable time considering the possibilities.  I am looking outside the Richmond area, and if you know of a senior level Ruby/Rails position with some managerial responsibilities, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</li>
<li>I attended my ten year high school reunion, and I would describe it as surreal and anticlimactic.  I expected to know more of the people who came.</li>
<li>I get married in less than ten days.</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> habitually, even though there&#8217;s really no point to doing so.</li>
<li>I tend to be a very calm person typically, but if I am hungry, that is a dangerous time to irk me.</li>
</ol>

	<p>I&#8217;m not going to tag anyone, you can do this if you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the &#8220;Totally Believable Department&#8221;</p>


<p><a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/<sub>r/wonkette/full/</sub>3/132760942/pentagon-cant-even-give-away-its-secret-war-plans-277408.php&#8221;&gt;Dept. Of For Everybody&#8217;s Eyes Only: Pentagon Can&#8217;t Even Give Away Its Secret War Plans</a>: &#8220;<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing all the <a class="tagautolink" title="Posts tagged as iraq" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/iraq/">Iraq</a> war plans are totally useless &mdash; otherwise our Determined Enemies might learn something from all the supposedly Top Secret documents just sitting on web servers that anybody can access.</p>

<p>If you want to know when and where the Army Corps of Engineers is building oil-pipeline stuff or security fences around <span class="caps">U.S. </span>bases or new torture prisons whatever, it&rsquo;s all online! You don&rsquo;t even need a password or anything.</p>

<p>To fuck with the military, Associated Press reporters are constantly downloading this stuff and then telling the Defense Department about the security problems. Then the Army guys scream and yell and demand that the AP reporters delete the secret plans and maps and whatever, but a week later it&rsquo;s all back on the same <a class="tagautolink" title="Posts tagged as computers" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/computers/">computers</a> again, ready for download.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is clearly trying to give this stuff away, but there just aren&rsquo;t any takers.</p>

According to the Pew Research people, only 49% of Americans now completely agree with the statement, &lsquo;I am patriotic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The percentage of True Patriots hasn&rsquo;t been so low since 1999, when the nation was wealthy and at peace.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been an absolutely batty six weeks.</p>


	<p>You already saw all about my trip to RailsConf.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been engaged in a lot of communication with the executive team at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERthought</a>, which is where I work.  Those communications have gone in a lot of different directions, but there have been a number of good outcomes.  I feel that I am contributing more to the organization in new ways that help me grow as a professional.  I&#8217;m cutting my teeth on preparing and presenting large-scale, long-term service engagements which is new to me.  That&#8217;s in addition to making sure that ALTERthought remains a premier supporter of Ruby on Rails in the Southeast.  Exciting stuff!</p>


	<p>And that&#8217;s in addition to actually performing my first billable work in a long time, and the first time I&#8217;ve worked for a client on site at my job.  I still haven&#8217;t left the Vantage Place parking lot since December of 2005 for my day job, though.  How bizarre.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.meganandjimswedding.com/">The wedding</a> approaches.  The invitations are set to go out on Monday.  There is a lot left to do, but Megan seems happy about taking it all on, at least.  We talked last night about how awesome the entire event is going to be.  I really hope that a lot of my friends scattered throughout the country will decide to come, although I know it can be expensive.</p>


	<p>My fantasy baseball team took the biggest toilet dive that I&#8217;ve ever managed.  A combination of injuries, bad drafting, and bad strategy are to blame.  Rice failed to make it to the title series in the College World Series for the second year in a row after beginning 2-0 in bracket play.  Not encouraging sports news, perhaps I&#8217;m earning karma for football season.</p>


	<p>Megan ended her school year successfully and is now weighing her options for employment.  Our financial advisor paid her a very nice compliment by indicating that he would like to see her working alongside him at New York Life.  There is a lot to respect about that company and that profession;  I also know that Megan would do a great job.</p>


	<p>Jeremy, Tasha, Bill, Rob, and Kate are all doing well, and I&#8217;m excited to have a close group of friends in town.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This presentation was one of the highlights of the conference to me.  For me, it was a perfectly structured talk.  It joins the <a href="/2007/5/24/railsconf-writeups-when-v-is-for-vexing">V is for Vexing</a>, <a href="/2007/6/1/railsconf-writeups-joyent-happy-hour">Joyent Happy Hour</a>, and the make_resourceful talk as the overall highlights of the conference for me.  (make_resourceful link coming soon!)</p>


	<p>In my experience, there are a lot of developers who are learning Ruby by programming in Rails.  Most of us know that Rails takes a lot of advantage of the advanced metaprogramming techniques in Ruby, but how many of us take the time to learn all the mechanics of how it works?  What made <a href="http://interblah.net/2007/5/20/the-dark-art-of-rails-plugins">this talk</a> so effective was that James was able to take a part of Rails that a lot of developers have to interact with (plugins) and explaining some of the Ruby magic behind how it all comes together.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;re left with a very solid understanding of how everything works behind the scenes.  As a result, you&#8217;re in a much better position to be able to write your own plugins, but also how to be a good plugin consumer.  Don&#8217;t waste any more time listening to me, <a href="http://assets.interblah.net/The_Dark_Art_of_Rails_Plugins_RailsConf_2007.pdf">download the talk</a> and check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This talk was a bit of a stretch for me, having never written an application that was even close to needing Memcached.  I had a great seat, though, and really enjoyed meeting Chris at the &#8220;Joyent Happy Hour&#8221;.  I also had just sat through a talk where all the concepts were familiar.  What was the worst that could happen?</p>


	<p>I ended up really enjoying the presentation for multiple reasons.  You can access his presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/err/kickin-ass-with-cachefu-without-notes/">here</a> and be sure to look around for the download option.  And get the version with notes!!!</p>


	<p>I loved the introduction which definitely made me feel like I might have been sitting there in that GameSpot booth with the same challenges.  (Although odds are good that I would have been watching the braniacs do the real work.)  He also didn&#8217;t set himself up as an expert, which I normally respond well to, especially if the speaker is obviously lying because he is in the middle of presenting at RailsConf.  I also really appreciated that he shared a mistake he made that brought down GameSpot.  Learning from others&#8217; mistakes is the best.</p>


	<p>The introduction to memcached couldn&#8217;t have been better, from my perspective.  I knew almost nothing about it, and learning very quickly about the basics was nice.  Everyone knows what a hash is like, and the presentation built appropriately from there.</p>


	<p>It takes balls to put a <span class="caps">YAGNI</span> slide 25 slides into your presentation&#8230; <strong>about your presentation itself!</strong></p>


	<p>The cache_fu plugin appears to be one of my favorite sort of plugins, the sort that does a lot of assembly and simplifying of other work.  The code was never that hard to grasp and his presentation is still available as a starting place.</p>


	<p>This presentation also sounded another note about using mocks and stubs.  Gotta look into getting more hands-on experience there.  Check out slide 70 for goodness sakes, although that&#8217;s not a result of mocha or stubba.</p>


	<p>The biggest take home for me is <strong>it&#8217;s OK to make mistakes</strong>.  It happens all the time.  The problem is not being able to react because you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.  That&#8217;s why you can listen to the front-runners and make sure that you do it as right as you can the first time out.</p>
