  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to introduce you to <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/tree/master">Blanket</a>, a library designed to make automated, remote backup easier.  I&#8217;ve had to set up automated backup before, and I wrote this package to make it more enjoyable for myself and others.  I was also experimenting with a lot of new technologies and techniques, which makes it even more rewarding that the end product ending being a preliminary success.</p>


	<p>An <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/quickstart">introduction to Blanket</a> is available at the excellent <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/blanket/">blanket project on RubyForge</a> which means that I also have my first Gem in the wild.</p>


	<p>Install it, kick it around, and if you like what you see, take a look at <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/todo">the development road map</a> and see if you&#8217;d like to get involved.  I have some GitHub invites if you need them, so please contact me if that&#8217;s an issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of January 2007, I made a list of my goals for what I wanted to accomplish before my 29th birthday in February of 2008.  There&#8217;s been so much change already that I think it&#8217;s OK to revisit this list in light of the first moments of 2008 being upon us.</p>


	<h3>Goals for the Blog</h3>


	<h4>Short term: Get the blog <span class="caps">URL</span> structure cemented as best as possible.</h4>


	<p>I am satisfied with what I got done here.  Without belaboring the point for those who don&#8217;t care too much, my goal was to get to a place where I would feel comfortable with Google no longer ignoring me.</p>


	<h4>Mid term: Get designer for personal site</h4>


	<p>I actually contacted someone who was willing to barter me some design skills for general technical excellence, but she backed out.  Oh, well!  I just picked a theme from the gallery as a result.</p>


	<h4>Year end: Have one two-word #1 Google result</h4>


	<p>I did accomplish this briefly&#8212;now appending &#8220;jimvanfleet&#8221; to the same query <span class="caps">STILL</span> doesn&#8217;t even get me first result.  Google, you&#8217;re so shifty!  I am going to change the form of this goal for next year to just encourage myself to create quality content.  Anyone familiar with this blog should realize that&#8217;s a major challenge for me. <img src="http://someguysblog.com/assets/2007/12/31/google-opensolaris-experience.png" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>Goals for <span class="caps">CISV USA</span></h3>


	<h4>Short term: Get the <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/"><span class="caps">CISV USA</span> webpage</a> moved to the new design</h4>


	<p>I am currently demoing a beta of another multiple-site <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a> installation to allow some chapters to have their home pages there.  This one is a success.</p>


	<h4>Mid term:  Get someone to help with mail administration</h4>


	<p>Total failure here.  Everyone I know is overqualified, and no one else has shown enough interest.</p>


	<h4>Year end:  Get one group using the wiki actively.</h4>


	<p>Still time on this one!  One more <span class="caps">EEC</span> retreat before my birthday, but I doubt it&#8217;ll work.</p>


	<h3>Goals for <span class="caps">CVREG</span></h3>


	<h4>Short term:  Complete what

	<p>It&#8217;s a great site, and I am very happy with my change in brokerage, regardless of my employment status.  If you are a stockholder, consider transferring your assets to TradeKing.  You can&#8217;t beat the price, and the customer support is top-notch.  You also get to play around and shoot me nasty messages if you find any bugs in the community site.  What could be better than that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Hello, again, all!  As <a href="/2007/8/10/an-update-by-being-tagged-was-8-habits-facts">my last update post</a> may have led you to believe, I have indeed been monstrously busy over the past several months.  It happens to the best of us.

Recently, however, I’ve managed to carve out enough time to do something that I’ve wanted to do for several years.  The website that you are now reading not only has <a href="http://www.someguysblog.com/">a snappy new domain</a> but also the same software runs a site for my main domain at <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/">jimvanfleet.com</a>.  This is the first time that software of <strong>any</strong> kind has run my main domain, so, for a geek like me, that’s pretty neat.

My belief is that this setup will allow me to lay out my thoughts and interests with structure (which blogs don’t really do) while still using the blog format (which is the best for keeping people up to date and retaining interest).  I’m getting to a point in my professional life where I expect to have to spend more time blogging to have the success that I’d like.  What a world, huh?

So welcome!  I know this is the first that you’ve heard from me in awhile, but I catch a flight to Iowa later today.  <span class="caps">IOWA</span>!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ezra&#8217;s Merb presentation was useful for someone like me with no exposure to the framework, but could have been sexier.  Where&#8217;s our 10 minute blog app?</p>


	<p>Adhearsion looks like it might make <span class="caps">VOIP</span> accessible to me, which is a pretty ridiculous notion.  If you&#8217;re thinking <span class="caps">VOIP</span> and Ruby, think Adhearsion.  I know the speaker is probably frustrated that his demo didn&#8217;t come off at the end, but that was going to be incredible if he pulled it off.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve heard Bruce Tate speak a number of times, but it&#8217;s clear to me that getting out of the Java sphere has actually been good for his psyche.  He speaks with a lot more passion now and asks interesting questions.  He&#8217;s not the only one asking them, but I think it&#8217;s pretty likely that some of my fellow attendees could really get something out of reflecting on his talk.</p>


	<p>Our social schedule led to missing the games development talk.  Ooops!</p>


	<p>The lightning round was relatively informative, and I preferred it to what I saw during the security talk at RailsConf.</p>


	<p>The birds of a feather session that I attended about using Rails for social good included discussion of a mailing list that I hope ends up happening.</p>


	<p>The presenters on the second day after that all did a great job.  Ken Ault gave a great talk about the Rails ecosystem and how the interrelations were important for Smalltalk and what Ruby can learn.  Smalltalk got a lot of &#8220;face-time&#8221; this weekend.</p>


	<p>Jared Richardson gave a really illuminating talk on the interrelationship between C and Ruby.</p>


	<p>Both talks I&#8217;m going to watch again at some point, and I think that&#8217;s one of the highest compliments I can pay.</p>


	<p>Marcel Molina wrapped up with a talk on beauty which really wasn&#8217;t to my tastes, although clearly many people in the crowd responded well to it.</p>


	<p>Overall, I think the organizers and the presenters did an incredible job of getting a lineup of interesting speakers and topics together in a place, delivering a great value, and bringing it off almost without a hitch.  Awesome job, and I give my compliments to everyone involved.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">OS X</span> on my new MacBook Pro for some time now, and I&#8217;m elated with it.  I have used <span class="caps">OS X</span> before, at Rice.  At that time, it was the only computer that I could do everything I would ever need to do from.  I&#8217;m over that, this time around.  I needed to be able to do even more, and <span class="caps">OS X</span> did not let me down.  I have had to pay a lot for software this time around, but we&#8217;ll get into that in a later post.</p>


	<h2>What I Run</h2>


	<h3>Web Browsing (and <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet">del.icio.us</a>) posting</h3>


	<p><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> and <a href="http://protagonist.co.uk/dashLicious/">dashLicious</a> are my preferred combo here, although I do run Firefox right now for GMail.  I may try out BonEcho, but my computer hasn&#8217;t shied under the load so far, so running two browsers is OK by me.  Camino delivers a Firefox level of browsing quality almost always, and pairs perfectly with dashLicious, which is kind enough to be browser agnostic.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a></h3>


	<p>Quicksilver is the majordomo for <span class="caps">OS X</span>.  &#8220;Albert, open my newsreader!&#8221;, &#8220;Albert, send this file over IM to my friend <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net">Jeremy</a>!&#8221;  Quicksilver has most of its functionality tied to Apple software, but plugins are available.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploadr</a></h3>


	<p>I use <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for my photosharing needs, and you can view the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigfleet">bigfleet photostream</a> to check it out yourself.  The tools are so much better than uploading directly using the web interface, it&#8217;s kind of a joke that I ever used the web in the first place.</p>


	<p>If you use Flickr, this tool is a must download.</p>


	<h3>Google Notifier and GMail Macros</h3>


	<p>The whole reason that I run two browsers is that the combination of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> and <a href="http://blog.persistent.info/2005/12/greasemonkey-christmas.html">GMail Macros</a> is so powerful.  The real inspiration for this post is that I have finally reached an empty inbox on GMail after clearing out nearly 2600 unread messages.  You can fly through tagging, archiving, and deleting messages with barely any time at all.  It really facilitates the sort of session that is advocated in Getting Things Done.</p>


	<p><a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html">Google Notifier</a> does the job of letting me know when I have new mail.  It also lets me know if I have just read a piece of mail (by displaying a &#8220;new&#8221; entry in the ten newest unread messages list) which is annoying but still worth it.</p>


	<h3>Handbrake, iSquint and Lostify</h3>


	<p>Just <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?p=305">read this</a> if you have an iPod.</p>


	<h3>NeoOffice</h3>


	<p>Even if <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a> is slow to start up, you can&#8217;t beat free.  Maybe the new iWork releases are awesome, though, and they&#8217;ll be worth paying for.</p>


	<h3>SSHKeychain</h3>


	<p>If you use <span class="caps">SSH</span> a lot, you can use <a href="http://scoops.totallyrule.com/articles/2005/10/25/sshkeychain">SSHKeychain</a> to stop typing your passwords.  If you&#8217;re like me, that actually makes a big difference.</p>


	<h3>Adium</h3>


	<p>Although I really wish that either <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> would work with Quicksilver or Yahoo would work with iChat, since neither of those seems to be imminent, it&#8217;s Adium for me.  Although I did get laid off, so I&#8217;m not really required to use Yahoo! IM anymore, so the iChat door is open again.</p>


	<h3>CocoaMySQL</h3>


	<p>MySQL is my favored database, and <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/index.html">CocoaMySQL</a> is my favorite interface to it on <span class="caps">OS X</span>.</p>


	<h3>Transmission</h3>


	<p>For BitTorrent on the Mac, my favorite application is <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a> although <a href="http://www.bitrocket.org/">BitRocket</a> shows a lot of promise.</p>


	<h3>Colloquy</h3>


	<p><span class="caps">IRC</span> is taken care of by <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>.  It&#8217;s the best <span class="caps">IRC</span> client that I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>


	<p>Have fun with this!</p>

<li>I am not going to finish up writing RailsConf 2007 like I said that I would.  I blame my readers for their utter lack of caring.  It&#8217;s just too far in the rear-view mirror now.  Next year, I&#8217;ll move more quickly.</li>
<li>I left on a trip for Europe on July 16 and returned on July 30.  It was an incredible trip, undoubtedly one I will remember for a long time.  The trip was with 10 high-school children from King William county where Megan taught this year.  I&#8217;m certainly going to try to blog about this.</li>
<li>The time between RailsConf and Europe was spent primarily on <span class="caps">XSLT</span> project with a Flash front-end.  That was different.</li>
<li>Two days after I came back to work, I was laid off by my employer.  It was four days before my ten-year high school reunion, and just over two weeks before <strong>The Big Day</strong>.  I&#8217;m interviewing with several places around the country, and having an enjoyable time considering the possibilities.  I am looking outside the Richmond area, and if you know of a senior level Ruby/Rails position with some managerial responsibilities, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</li>
<li>I attended my ten year high school reunion, and I would describe it as surreal and anticlimactic.  I expected to know more of the people who came.</li>
<li>I get married in less than ten days.</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> habitually, even though there&#8217;s really no point to doing so.</li>
<li>I tend to be a very calm person typically, but if I am hungry, that is a dangerous time to irk me.</li>
</ol>

	<p>I&#8217;m not going to tag anyone, you can do this if you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the &#8220;Totally Believable Department&#8221;</p>


<p><a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/<sub>r/wonkette/full/</sub>3/132760942/pentagon-cant-even-give-away-its-secret-war-plans-277408.php&#8221;&gt;Dept. Of For Everybody&#8217;s Eyes Only: Pentagon Can&#8217;t Even Give Away Its Secret War Plans</a>: &#8220;<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing all the <a class="tagautolink" title="Posts tagged as iraq" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/iraq/">Iraq</a> war plans are totally useless &mdash; otherwise our Determined Enemies might learn something from all the supposedly Top Secret documents just sitting on web servers that anybody can access.</p>

<p>If you want to know when and where the Army Corps of Engineers is building oil-pipeline stuff or security fences around <span class="caps">U.S. </span>bases or new torture prisons whatever, it&rsquo;s all online! You don&rsquo;t even need a password or anything.</p>

<p>To fuck with the military, Associated Press reporters are constantly downloading this stuff and then telling the Defense Department about the security problems. Then the Army guys scream and yell and demand that the AP reporters delete the secret plans and maps and whatever, but a week later it&rsquo;s all back on the same <a class="tagautolink" title="Posts tagged as computers" href="http://wonkette.com/politics/computers/">computers</a> again, ready for download.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is clearly trying to give this stuff away, but there just aren&rsquo;t any takers.</p>

Of National Disgrace: Majority of Americans Now UnAmerican; Nation Renamed UnAmerica</a>: &#8220;<p><img src="http://wonkette.com/images/thumbs/1ccf5c192de97a1b3aca407324ef3fbd.jpg" alt="STALIN SPIDER IS WATCHING U MASTURBATE - Wonkette" title="STALIN SPIDER IS WATCHING U MASTURBATE - Wonkette" class="right" />A shocking new survey proves that the majority of Americans are now, in fact, anti-American. According to the Pew Research people, only 49% of Americans now completely agree with the statement, &lsquo;I am patriotic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The percentage of True Patriots hasn&rsquo;t been so low since 1999, when the nation was wealthy and at peace.</p>
