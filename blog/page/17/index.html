  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even before vacation kicks off (so I can try to build up my collection of blog postings once more), I wanted to get a post out there about how I&#8217;m feeling about the technology transition I&#8217;ve been making recently.</p>


	<h2>From Java&#8230;</h2>


	<p>I recently wrapped up the bulk of my involvement with the job I had before I started at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERthought</a>.  I&#8217;ll still be available for training and consultation purposes.  I no longer have weekly visits scheduled.  I&#8217;m not responsible for getting anything implemented, etc.</p>


	<p>That in itself is a good feeling.  I am proud of the product I produced.  The project is being maintained by a developer who had no exposure to Java whatsoever 6 months ago.</p>


	<p>What I have a good chance of remembering as clearly as anything else is the last feature I added.  It took me about six weeks of calendar time to implement something I felt that I could have done with Rails in about two days.  To be clear, there were false starts, and I only got to work on the project for a couple of hours at a time.</p>


	<p>It makes me sad to think, like a best friend from elementary school, my most pleasant days with Java web development might be gone forever.  If we meet again, it likely won&#8217;t be in the best of circumstances.  My old friend will have been on a two-year bender, hanging out with shady programmers who maybe aren&#8217;t out explicitly to corrupt him, but perhaps they just don&#8217;t know any better.  But perhaps it was all my fault!  I would never call on him to go out to the bar with me, where we would used to talk about how we wanted to change the world.  Very sad, indeed.</p>


	<h2>Rails and <span class="caps">AJAX</span></h2>


	<p>Rails is getting my calls, these days.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of exposure to the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and Rails mixture recently, and it&#8217;s one powerful combo.  Rails has server-side elements that make <span class="caps">AJAX</span> easy to use (like <span class="caps">RJS</span> templates) and view elements (e.g. form_remote_tag and link_to_remote) that also make it easy to integrate Prototype-based <span class="caps">AJAX</span> calls without worrying about &#8220;how to do&#8221; <span class="caps">AJAX</span>.    There&#8217;s this feeling I get as I dive more deeply into Rails that once I work with Rails as much as I have with Java, that the (ed. note&#8212;the rest of this sentence is lost forever.)</p>


	<p>For the record, this project will be at one person week on Thursday, and is already five use cases deep.  I&#8217;ve also completely rearranged the domain model twice.  A similar change on a Java project will probably take me a few months calendar time to get right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
I think it is very important for you to do two things: act on your temporary conviction as if it was a real conviction; and when you realize that you are wrong, correct course very quickly. And try not to get too depressed in the part of the journey, because there&#8217;s a professional responsibility. If you are depressed, you can&#8217;t motivate your staff to extraordinary measures. So you have to keep your own spirits up even though you well understand that you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.</blockquote>

	<p>from Andy Grove via <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/05/ten_questions_w.html">Guy Kawasaki and Bob Sutton</a></p>


	<p>I&#8217;m in a position at work where it&#8217;s time to grab my hardhat and get to the work of managing.  The complication is that the people I&#8217;m working with both, technically, outrank me.  I&#8217;m building a hedge fund at work, which is a project which plays directly to my strengths and education.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve faced some recent difficulty, however, and I&#8217;ve seen enough to believe that the best solution is for me to make sure that my beliefs get out there.  I think my concerns are the most useful match with the external shareholders, and fortunately I think that a little more rigor is what the project needs.  So it&#8217;s time to step up.  This is playing directly to my weakness.  I like my hubris well-contained normally.</p>


	<p>The above quote really resonated with me, and I hope it&#8217;s right, because that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m trying to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My longest absence ever from the blog, more than a month and a half.  I can only say that I was needed elsewhere.  I&#8217;ve been reminded recently about how I used to post about the smallest things, like the fact that it&#8217;s so much easier to appreciate Lennox Lewis&#8217;s career now that the heavyweight division is horrible.  But these thoughts wither and die as I&#8217;m on my way from one place to another and I just haven&#8217;t gotten them up.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one cares anyway.  But, anyway, at least the drought is over now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Well, they say they want another few weeks to polish the release for commercial support.  Surely it&#8217;s OK for me to go ahead and pin myself to dapper and upgrade my distribution&#8230;&#8221;</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m still recovering.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m no longer running FreeBSD at all, nor do I even have a Windows partition (although I do wish I could find my disc so that I can install XP in my VMWare&#8212;that is, when I get my OS back into a reasonable state).  Ubuntu is really fantastic, but it can make a neophyte overconfident very easily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
	<li>I am doing a lot of stuff right now, and so the blog is suffering.  Isn&#8217;t that just the way of things?</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Megan enjoyed her birthday very much, thanks mostly to a ring I got her that exceeded any expectation I had of how good it might be.  Besides the ring, though, I&#8217;m just glad it made her happy.  She certainly reported the reaction I was looking for from her friends and students.  She fielded the &#8220;When are you going to get married?&#8221; questions as best she could, although she was happy to pass those same questions along to me.  I am still working on the answer.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am totally in love with XM Radio.  I&#8217;m learning about when my favorite artists come out with new albums, finding out about new artists I like but have never heard of (e.g. Something For Rockets), and, uh, listening to more dance music.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Mogwai was an excellent show.  Thank god I was able to get Megan her earplugs.  I am reminded once again, though, that I am getting older.  The show was over at just after midnight, and we had to stop twice on the way home to catch quick naps.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The new oven is incredible.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>If Oprah was looking to call James Frey out, she obviously didn&#8217;t read My Friend Leonard;  I&#8217;d be shocked if truths outnumbered fictions in that book.  What a crock of horseshit.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/">Art DeVany</a> didn&#8217;t need very much time to start blogging again after his wife passed away. Not that it was a surprise to me. He is an extremely interesting fellow.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am using <a href="http://www.feedlounge.com/">FeedLounge</a> to keep up with the blogosphere, and it&#8217;s doing a fantastic job.  My Dreamhost referrals pay for it, so I get to enjoy the fruits of my residuals.  If you are interested in a web host, I will be glad to outline the plusses and minuses of the ones with which I am familiar.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am wishing that my notecard system for Getting Things Done would have held up, but I just keep losing them.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to wait until I get Palm-like functionality from my cell phone.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I got a Nintendo DS with Metroid Pinball, Tetris DS, and the Castlevania game.  Totally sweet.  I am a Nintendo fan at heart, and the new Zelda game is going to be ridiculous.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am not playing around with Ruby too much at the moment, but I was encouraged when Don from work asked to take the Pickaxe home with him.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> The &#8220;test-your-might-for-free&#8221; server I acquired from Sun found a happy recipient in Don, as well.  I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s taking the captaincy of the &#8220;blog about beating the hell out of this server and we might let you keep it&#8221; project.  I really don&#8217;t have room for any more.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I had an interesting dinner with <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/">Jeremy</a> the other week</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am working on getting a geek dinner set up for here in Richmond, but details are still being worked out before I announce it.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> The nutty geek order I talked about last time was hoodwink.d and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really all that cool.  A totally sweet undertaking technically, and why? is pretty much awesome regardless.  I was happy to learn about XPath, though, that&#8217;s a useful trick.  I&#8217;ll be very happy when <span class="caps">XHTML</span> is the only way to go.  Well-formedness is nice.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m adding more gear to my home network.  I got a <span class="caps">NAS</span> device from Buffalo Technolgy that is working quite well so far.  I also finally got printing from Megan&#8217;s iBook over our wireless network to our wireless print server working.  I&#8217;ll try to post a blog about that soon;  It&#8217;s quite hard and there&#8217;s almost 0 good information out there about it.  Help me Google Juice.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>As always, I am a total dork.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I think I&#8217;ll be sending my sister a care package in the next few days.  But is she already so bored that she didn&#8217;t read this far?  Only time can say for sure!</li>
	</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three balls in the hopper:</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m very close to the end of my previous job at Dominion Medical Management.  It&#8217;s been tough for me to create the time I need to work on it while staying sane.  Fortunately, I am very close to done.  Working on plain old Java webapps suddenly seems like the farthest thing from my mind, but it&#8217;s good to know that I can do it in a pinch.</p>


	<p>I no longer technically work for ALTERthought.  The work I did with a new client that I was assigned to proved to be fruitful enough that we&#8217;ve partnered together on a new venture.  As such, my contract has been assigned.  Or something.  I&#8217;m vague on the details, but my paycheck is coming from a new place.</p>


	<p>The new venture is called Canal Street Capital (don&#8217;t bother, we don&#8217;t have a website yet).  Our goal is to create a hedge fund.  I don&#8217;t want to get too far into the details of what I&#8217;m doing before we get input from the law team, since we&#8217;re talking about real money now.  It&#8217;s an extremely exciting project&#8212;one that uses almost everything I&#8217;ve learned either formally at Rice or informally on my own.  I hope to be able to provide more details soon.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=jimvanfleetco-20&#38;o=1&#38;p=8&#38;l=as1&#38;asins=B0000019PA&#38;fc1=000000&#38;=1&#38;lc1=0000ff&#38;bc1=000000&#38;lt1=_blank&#38;IS2=1&#38;bg1=ffffff&#38;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px; float:left;margin:15px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" class="amazon"></iframe>

	<p><a href="amazon:B0000019PA">In The Aeroplane Over The Sea</a> is one of those records where people either know instantly what you&#8217;re talking about or look at you like you are from Mars.  &#8220;Neutral Milk Hotel?&#8221; they say. &#8220;Sounds like something I don&#8217;t want around my children.&#8221;</p>


	<p>And, to be honest, they&#8217;re probably right.  Those who&#8217;ve listened to <em>Invent Yourself a Shortcake</em> know that it&#8217;s possible for Jeff Mangum (the driving force behind <span class="caps">NMH</span>) to engage in the sort of arty-noise that I really do not like.  Mangum personally was (and likely is) a prodigious drug user;  I have a live show on <span class="caps">KCRW</span> where he admits to having the flu and being on an acid trip for about three days before taping.  Mothers, lock up your daughters!</p>


	<p>But <a href="amazon:B0000019PA">In The Aeroplane Over The Sea</a> is one of the poppiest, yummiest rock records to come out of the independent scene in my lifetime.  Accordians, horns (distorted and otherwise), guitar tracks that sounds like they were resurrected from a deteriorating 2-track, and that bizarre <strong>voice</strong> contribute to a singular sort of record.  You hear The Decemberists comparisons nowadays, and I can see why.  Both share bizarre instrumentation, affected vocal style, strange lyrics.  What sets <em>Aeroplane</em> apart is its energy and unpredictible nature.  Plus, I think it&#8217;s a good bit more fun&#8212;not that <a href="amazon:B00008XS4D">Castaways And Cutouts</a> isn&#8217;t a great record, too.</p>


	<p>The record is something that has to be heard to know if you&#8217;d like it or not, so go try it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
	<li> Megan and I continue to do well, although recently I think we&#8217;ve both been so exhausted that we aren&#8217;t doing a great deal after we get home from work and all our scheduled extra-curriculars.  I think we both want to refocus, but I&#8217;ll need to borrow some of her strength to say no sometimes.  There are so many good causes out there&#8230;</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Megan&#8217;s Academic Challenge team finished 3rd in the state for their school size!  I was their humble scorekeeper.  I had a lot of fun, both because her kids are great and because it was fun to get exposure to one of the high-school &#8220;sports&#8221; I liked doing.  It was a very impressive finish, and her team should be very proud.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m seeing Mogwai tomorrow night.  It hasn&#8217;t really sunk in yet.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>We are very much enjoying our new oven.  Sometimes the little things, like having an oven that works on settings other than broil, are life&#8217;s true joys.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am working like a dog at work, but to call it an exciting project would be an understatement.  Nearly everything that I&#8217;ve learned either via formal instruction or as a hobby is being used in one form or another.  It&#8217;s best for me if I stay somewhat mum until we have some actual promotional material that I can point you towards.   I am at work right now, drinking a beer, though.  That&#8217;s a plus.  We beat our original target date for completion of what we&#8217;ve got thus far by six weeks.  I have a lot to do with that, as well, which feels great.  As soon as I get some rest&#8230;</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am playing a game called <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">The Battle For Wesnoth</a> which was called &#8220;The OpenOffice of gaming: extensive, fascinating and free of charge&#8221; by one reviwer on their home page.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite games ever, which means that now is a particularly bad time to have found it.  I need to be doing something else!</li>

<time datetime="2006-02-16T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 16<span>th</span>, 2006</time> - 
        


        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently attended the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic <span class="caps">AJAX</span></a> training session in Reston, VA.  Here&#8217;s my writeup!</p>


	<h2>The Excellent</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>I couldn&#8217;t have been more impressed with the speakers&#8217; ability to quickly incorporate our feedback into their presentation.  I was not alone, I&#8217;m sure, when I indicated that the attendees would benefit from more hands-on experience with coding in <span class="caps">AJAX</span>.  Overnight, we were granted the ability to begin experimenting with some of their presentation slides using <span class="caps">AJAX</span> techniques during their lecture!  This proved to be the ultimate bite-size morsel to accompany the more substantive formal labs.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I very much enjoyed the exposure to <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/index.html">Selenium</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/">Selenium <span class="caps">IDE</span></a> for Firefox.  I hope to be able to get more hands-on with this technology in the near future.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Although Stu was not married to the diagram they prepared outlining the various areas in which both client-side and server-side <span class="caps">AJAX</span> technologies could possibly contribute, I felt that the diagram gave me a very useful tool in evaluating any prospective <span class="caps">AJAX</span> toolkit that walks in the door.  The first thing that happened to me upon returning from this training was &#8220;Have you heard of <em><span class="caps">AJAX</span> Framework A</em> or <em><span class="caps">AJAX</span> Framework B</em>?&#8221;  The answer was that I hadn&#8217;t, but  at least I have a good rule-of-thumb for figuring out how we might best be able to use that framework.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Our login to <a href="http://www.codecite.com/">Codecite</a> works, and the presentations are available there!  This practically eliminates the need for an explicit debriefing session from me.  <strong>Wow!</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<h2>The Good</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> for providing a discount in order to purchase the Pragmatic <span class="caps">AJAX</span> book.  I had already purchased it, but now their excellent Rails Recipies book can be mine.  And I got it for cheap!</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>They&#8217;re not directly responsible, but I&#8217;m happy that <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> exists.  I would never dream of writing more than 100 lines of JavaScript without this framework in tow, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> or not.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>The Not-So-Good</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Justin, be yourself, but you could probably calm down slightly.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>While it&#8217;s not the responsibility of the speakers or the organizers, I would have enjoyed the ability to discuss some of the application of what we were learning with my fellow classmates after hours.</li>
	</ul>
