<time datetime="2003-09-01T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 1<span>st</span>, 2003</time> - 
        


        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first thing that I&#8217;ll say about the book is that it is hard to read.  It&#8217;s by far the most demanding of the non-fiction I&#8217;ve been reading.  This book has prerequisites if you want to read it.  <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">The Dancing Wu Li Masters</a> is a must, and I wish I had read <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385235690/jimvanfleetco-20">the other book that I bought about quantum physics</a> before this.  Prepare yourself, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>


	<p>The essence of <a href="http://superstringtheory.com/">superstring</a> theory is relatively simple;  you, if you ever did think about it, probably thought of the elementary particles as being points.  Superstring theory claims that they are, in fact, small strings vibrating in a certain way.  This theory can claim to incorporate gravity <strong>itself</strong> in a meaningful and fundamental way, predicting the properties of the gravitron.  This in itself is pretty exciting to physicists.  (Note that Einstein&#8217;s general relativity mentions gravity, but only to hand-wave it into accelerated motion).  There&#8217;s no doubt that the potential of string theory (as it&#8217;s more commonly known) is quite impressive.  It&#8217;s the first human attempt at an actual <a href="http://theoryofeverything.org/TOE/toe-4.htm">Theory of Everything</a>.  (In searching for that link, I also found <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">this one</a>, which has a really interesting picture.  &#8220;You are here.&#8221;)  Greene also notes that even opponents of string theory have no better or different theories as yet, and concede that their own areas of research seem to be stagnating.</p>


	<p>String theory also predicts seemingly crazy stuff, like the universe is not four space-time dimensions, but eleven.  The other seven spatial dimensions exist on such microscopic scales, however, that we&#8217;re unable to see or interact with them in any way.  Got that?  It also predicts that black holes have a temperature, which seems outlandish, but seems to actually be true.  This is one of the only testable bits of string theory.</p>


	<p>Therein lies the biggest criticism of string theory thus far;  there&#8217;s no way to tell if it&#8217;s right or wrong.  There&#8217;s hope that when a <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/cern/">supercollider in Geneva</a> becomes operational at the end of the decade that string theorists will finally have evidence for some of their theories.  Greene points out that even if string theory is wrong, the field has spurred new developments in &#8220;point physics&#8221;, so it&#8217;s not a total waste.</p>


	<p>So, in one sense, the book worked.  I&#8217;ll be paying attention to what that thing clears up, and I&#8217;ll actually try to answer people that wonder why we spend millions of dollars on these things.  Maybe it&#8217;ll go something like &#8220;So you can finally get your jet-pack to the eighth dimension, stupid!&#8221;  It does face deductions for ease of reading and potential relevance.  When all it said and done, though, it could be a great primer for a very important set of ideas about the universe.  I&#8217;ll give it <strong>8.4/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><dl>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>The Manchurian Candidate</strong></font></dt>
<dd>I had two thoughts after I finished watching this movie.  The first was that &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe this movie is that old!&#8221;  Besides the &#8220;Haha, look at the scary communists!&#8221; factor we have in today&#8217;s viewings, during release, this was deadly serious stuff.  But this movie is about 60% plot (which you can read about elsewhere) and 40% well-done character development.  Sinatra himself has the flattest one, but he <strong>does</strong> know kung fu.

The other was that &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this movie hasn&#8217;t been remade.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure Hollywood will get around to it at some point.  They better hurry and get Jude Law:  he&#8217;s a dead ringer for the assassin!  I couldn&#8217;t recommend this movie more highly, anything that old which stands up that well deserves at least a <strong>9.4/10</strong></dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>The Bridge On The River Kwai</strong></font></dt>
<dd>This one is more famous, and has Obi-Wan Kenobi in it.  Seriously, Alec Guiness is great in this movie, playing a British major who is determined to do things the &#8220;right&#8221; way.  By the time he&#8217;s almost convinced you, you realize he&#8217;s completely delusional and that time in the &#8216;hot box&#8217; probably fried his brains.  This is another war movie where the characters have depth, the plot is compelling.  It doesn&#8217;t dig straight to the soul of man the way I feel The Thin Red Line did, for instance, but it&#8217;s still worthwhile.  I give it an <strong>8.2/10</strong></dd>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>He spends the first four chapters of the book setting up some basics about computers which I will (magically) do for you here in one paragraph.  Most people are familiar with the notion that computers work with these things called bits, plain old 1s and 0s.  These group together into integers (in binary format, but still).  There&#8217;s an old and well-established area of study concerning the computing power of integers, and the thinking which has reigned for many years is that essentially, all these computers can do the same thing.  A person adequately trained could do all the computations on an abacus that a computer could&#8212;it&#8217;s just a matter of speed and accuracy.  Although their powers seem mystical (or damnable) at times, computers are really not all that special.  Blam, I saved you 45 minutes.</p>


	<p>The book does give a description of what allows quantum computing to be powerful.  It adds a new state to the mix: 1+0.  This is known as the superposition.  A bit can be on, off, or both at once.  This is a direct consequence of using sub-atomic particles as switches.  He explains why this is useful for the rest of the chapter, but he does it best with one sentence.  It means that instead of representing one number with a binary string, let&#8217;s say 64 (10000000), you can represent <strong>all</strong> the numbers from 0 to 64 at one time by having each bit in the superposition.  He demonstrates an algorithm for prime factorization which would really kick ass if these things were up and running.  It&#8217;s not known that factorization is a &#8220;hard&#8221; problem, though.</p>


	<p>One of the reasons that I was excited about quantum computing is the power it might give us to attack problems that are known to be &#8220;hard&#8221;.  There&#8217;s a whole family of them, and people with Ph.D. after their names are attacking various problems of this nature.  After reading this book, my thinking is that while it&#8217;s a strong step forward, we&#8217;re still not on the path to being able to solve &#8220;hard&#8221; problems easily.  After all, ternary logic has been possible <i>in silica</i> for some time now.  &#8220;Is that really all there is to quantum computing?&#8221;  I&#8217;m thinking.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some subtle point I&#8217;m still missing, since very smart people are still working on this.  Besides the simple fact that quantum computers are smaller than Gigli&#8217;s box office, I can&#8217;t really see any advantages any more.</p>


	<p>The book also covers material I essentially had no interest in, like how the scientists are actually implementing quantum computers and quantum cryptography.  I question why the first is even in a popular science book; what casual reader is interested in implementation details, even if there are five different ones?  As for the second, it turns out that there&#8217;s a nifty, exploitable property of bits in the superposition which can possibly aid in secure key generation and transmission, which is essentially the entire security problem (as long as you handle the rest of your business, which, trust me, you aren&#8217;t.)  If you examine a bit in the superposition, it becomes either 1 or 0, but there&#8217;s no telling which.  (Yet, the physicists will be working on that indefinitely)  This helps foil people listening in, via a process explained in more detail in the book.</p>


	<p>A Shortcut Through Time is extremely easy to read.  I finished it on planes and in airports.  It&#8217;s an excellent introduction to things like computability, algorithms, and computer science in general for people who have no idea about that kind of stuff, but are interested in computer science.  I recommend the book for that audience, but for me, this book is a <strong>6.8/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><dl>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Vacation is over.</strong></font></dt>
<dd> I read all the books I left with over that week.  The brain is getting pretty limber!  Already posted is the review of the book I read before the break.  I&#8217;ll hope to have one more up every night till they&#8217;re all up.  It was very enlightening, although I finally read some books that I didn&#8217;t think were that great.  Virginia Beach itself seemed pretty average.  The family&#8217;s doing pretty well, although it&#8217;s a time of big flux still.  It&#8217;s tough to gauge everyone when I spend so much time away.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>The Me Sale</strong></font></dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m trying to get rid of a lot of my stuff to keep from having to move it.  I&#8217;m tired of being so heavyweight.  I posted two notices about the stuff I was selling, and now two items remain less than 24 hours later.  If this keeps up, I&#8217;ll be more than ready to go when the movers show up, maybe before my dad shows up.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Classes Start and I&#8217;m Not There</strong></font></dt>
<dd>To be on Rice campus without feeling excited about classes starting is very strange.  The fact that I&#8217;m excited to be leaving is even stranger.  I&#8217;m actually kind of getting a thrill about having my own responsibilities on campus draw to a close.</dd>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Naturally, in a book this good, it only takes 31 pages to mention Knoxville.  It turns out my hometown is the only other place (mentioned in this book at least) besides Southeast Asia where the naturally synchronizing fireflies reside.  Starting with some foundation work done years ago into synchronization done 20 years ago, Strogatz quickly catches us up to speed with the current state of the science.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s some of the topics that are on the back of the dust jacket, and the treatment they get from inside the dust jacket:</p>


<ul>
<li>Why traffic jams can occur even when there&#8217;s no accident or other apparent cause
</li>
<li>Why women roommates sometimes find that their menstrual periods occur in sync
</li>
<li>What caused hundreds of Japanese children to fall into seizures while watching an episode of Pokemon
</li>
<li>What triggers riots, fads, and mass hysteria
</li>
<li>How synchrony in the solar system may have been responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs
</li>
<li>How consciousness arises from the interplay of millions of mindless braincells
</li>
</ul>

	<p>You may think, &#8220;Hey, this sounds interesting!&#8221;  But apparently the dust-jacket writers were just looking for the things <strong>they</strong> understood, because these topics average one or two pages of coverage apeice.  The topics that get real coverage play just as well, though.  You&#8217;ll find applications of sync in the power grid (and what seems certainly to be elements of what happened during the blackout), the human sleep cycle, chaotic systems, bridge building, lasers, and many others.</p>


	<p>Some other subtexts that seemed interesting at the time:</p>


<ul>
<li>Strogatz points out just how prescient human ingenuity can be in several cases.  Mendel postulation of genes before he even ran his pea experiments, Einstein declaring that there would be a laser 43 years before it actually happened, and others.  A later review will make some counter-points, but I love reading about how smart some people are.  Go genius!</li>
<li>Thomas Edison founded General Electric.  That&#8217;s a fun fact for parties.</li>
<li>&#8220;Mystic&#8221; type stuff pokes its head around the corner a couple of times.  <a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/">This fella</a>, who had the brains to advance some aspects of quantum physics a great deal (including winning a Nobel Prize at 33) is now studying telepathy, spoon-bending, etc.  Some of the analogies he makes about chaotic systems and quantum cryptography instantly bring to mind similar analogies made in the <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">Dancing Wu Li Masters</a>, which grows in my estimation with each other book I read.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t see that the book has a lot of weaknesses.  I give it a <strong>9.5/10</strong> with some points taken off for not having a magic bit of explanation covered within.  It has lots of neat tidbits and ideas, but no one idea really feels like &#8220;Wow, this changes how I look at humanity or the world.  Or something.  Dood.&#8221;</p>
