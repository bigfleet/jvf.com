  <div class="entry-content">The plot begins when a news anchor has a bit of a breakdown when he&#8217;s sacked and announces that he will commit suicide on the program in two weeks time.  Conveniently, there&#8217;s a shareholder meeting the next night which pisses the anchor&#8217;s boss off enough to let the maniac back on the air, and people start watching the show.  This is, without a doubt, the strongest arc of any of the multiple things going on in this movie, the only one, in my opinion, which sustains the full weight that this move feels it has.  I won&#8217;t get into what happens, but I will say that everything having to do with this story line I felt was very impressive.
<table border="1" align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
<table align="right"><tr><td align="center"><img src="http://www.uni-television.com/jerry/resources/right.tv.ani.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>This is the best picture I could find without having to pay $9.95</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
There are two major subplots.  The first deals with the head of the news division and Fay Dunaway, a prototype of the programming director who brought you Jerry Springer.  The second concerns the Dunaway character&#8217;s involvement with a terrorist group that she puts on the air.

	<p>The first I find completely unconvincing.  We don&#8217;t see any reason why these two should have any chemistry at all, or maybe I missed that three minutes.  I feel it drags down the rest of the movie while not providing any real substantive value, besides letting the news director get inside for some body shots on the mentality creating this kind of television.  I found it grating and distracting.</p>


	<p>The second showcases a communist radical who does quite a good capatalist impression once the money shows up.  This subplot fares a lot better.</p>


	<p>I feel like a review of this movie without a discussion among other people who watched it is not quite complete.  Most of the reviews you&#8217;ll see elsewhere are unswervingly high.  I still recommend the movie, simply because it deals with an interesting topic in an interesting way.  Disagreeing with its message, or not finding the characters really all that credible is another issue.</p>


	<p>The movie is loud, and attacks in every direction.  That means that sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses, and sometimes you&#8217;re wondering what the hell is happening!  For it&#8217;s time, the movie would have to be considered unbelievable.  The fact that it could see what was happening so far in advance (a bit like the psychic they put on the news show) is worthy of the highest commendation.  The only way it retains this kind of value today is if you watch with other people and talk about it.  The movie&#8217;s messages are simply too scattered to put them all together.  I give it a <strong>7.2/10</strong> and add a bonus point if you know what TV was like in those days.</p>

	<p>I installed a poll subsystem, you should see that over on the right.  The first question has to do with the linked article from <span class="caps">ESPN</span>.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I root for womankind against the oppresive elements of mankind all the time, but isn&#8217;t <a href="http://espn.go.com/wnba/news/2003/0722/1584313.html" target="_blank">this</a> taking it a little far?  Leave a comment, vote, whatever.</p>


I&#8217;m scared enough of the <span class="caps">RIAA I</span> took down my music list.  I&#8217;ve been ready to stop trading for a short time, actually, even without their subpoenas.  This reminds me.  There&#8217;s only two reasons to take Latin:  it makes learning any other language a piece of cake, and you can spell words like &#8220;subpoena&#8221; without having to look them up.  I invited a guest author to speak on the topic, maybe he&#8217;ll restore my courage.

I&#8217;m about half way through my next book, look for that review before next week is out.  It&#8217;s been every bit as good as <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">Wu Li</a>, but  it&#8217;s two or three times as long.  And I can&#8217;t tell you what it is, it&#8217;s a secret.

	<p>I was so stressed about what to do with my Friday night, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier that I spend it talking to friends and getting a couple of things up here.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, the pictures.  I don&#8217;t pretend to have a full grasp of what we&#8217;re doing in Iraq, but I have some theories.  If we do find Saddam, GW is going to have a hell of a time convincing America that our boys still belong over there.  Also, no matter if you agree with our policy or not, why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://www.uso.org/pubs/8_18_23.cfm">donate to the <span class="caps">USO</span></a>.  They don&#8217;t even get to phone home for free, people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I finally did watch it, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I suppose that I was wrong not to give <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Crowe,+Cameron">Cameron Crowe</a> the benefit of the doubt, because even if his films haven&#8217;t been works of art, they have never been <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120915">trash</a>, either.</p>


	<p>What you get with Say Anything is a pleasant, little high-school drama.  You have a sensitive-not-paralyzed young man charming a beautiful, intelligent, yet curiously not universally lusted over young lady.  It fit into my framework of the way things like this go.  No spoilers, but the interplay between the men in her life and her gravitation towards them seems to be no surprise.</p>


	<p>Still, I just don&#8217;t know what to say about this movie.  It should be required viewing for sophomores in high-school, but if you&#8217;re already older than that, there&#8217;s really no point that I can see.  Perhaps if you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> a nice-type guy, you could see what kind of reaction your girl has to Lloyd.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got to wrap this up, because of time constraints.  It&#8217;s a pleasant movie, which you might like watching as a matinee while you do something else that&#8217;s important.  Like, say, I did.  Otherwise, start it as a <strong>10/10</strong> if you&#8217;re 14, and substract half a point a year until you hit college, then give it a one point deduction then, leaving a <strong>7/10</strong></p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It never threatens to become <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0339034">typical romantic fare</a>, because the movie has something called <a HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=scope">scope.</a>  The movie starts with a focus on the main character as a child.  As most young boys do, he likes to do what he wants, and not what he&#8217;s told.  What he wants to do is go to the movies.  He strikes up a friendship with the projectionist, and ends up becoming his protégé.  These early scenes are very well done.  The characters are well played, seeming natural and the friendship seems genuine.  Perhaps even more impressive is the <strong>scene</strong> which is laid.  The town (forgot the name) is just as much a character in the story as anyone with lines.  You feel the community in this town, and it&#8217;s amazing the depth they create with only the scenes in the theatre and a few others as raw material.</p>


	<p>The main character becomes a young man, who is taken with a new girl, the daughter of a prominent banker.  His attempts to charm her are charming, and atypical.  We see many slipups, but he never given up his attempts, no matter how grevious his missteps.  Eventually, he wins the girl&#8217;s heart.</p>


	<p>After that is when the movie really starts to get going.  She faces the prospects of having to leave for a university, as well as being betrothed to another different man by her father.  How does it all turn out?  And how does the projectionist fit into their story?  You&#8217;ll have to watch to find out, and believe me, it&#8217;s worth it.</p>


	<p>I feel the real highlight of this film, though, is the power with which it presents a homecoming after a long abscence.  I haven&#8217;t left home for anything like the 30 years which the narrator uses to build his career as (what else?) a film director.  But when he comes back, he is laid bare.  He had expected his years away to make him stronger, to make him able to face some of the things that happened to him, to dull the pain.  In this town, though, he&#8217;s the same person he ever was, like the intervening years had never happened, or they had happened to someone else.  He doesn&#8217;t just say these things either, you feel them.  He enters his old room, watches his old movies&#8230;  It&#8217;s devestating to watch a successful man become a strange sort of shell for a love-struck boy.</p>


	<p>This is a bittersweet movie.  It doesn&#8217;t seem like anyone gets exactly what they deserve.  The very end of the movie, however, is a perfect conclusion, wrapping up all the main themes and giving a ride down memory lane, as well.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s difficult to know what to deduct for from this movie.  It&#8217;s long, but that shouldn&#8217;t necessarily take away from your score.  I&#8217;ll call it a one point deduction for replay value;  I don&#8217;t feel a paticular need to see the movie again.  But this is an excellent move, one that earns every point of its <strong>9/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I sent around the first message to most everybody who might be interested in this page just because I&#8217;m doing it.  Eventually, maybe some other people will be fooled into thinking it has some kind of merit or something.</p>


	<p>Anyway, my goal is to make it to your bookmarks and actually have you come back every once in awhile.  So check things out, come back to this thread and leave a comment letting me know what you&#8217;d like to see more of!</p>


	<p>Hope you enjoy looking around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s get this out of the way, right off.  This book has, as far as I can tell, two goals: to pique your interest in quantum physics and its sub-fields, and to convince you that certain beliefs that you&#8217;re likely to have about the world are not supported by experiments performed in it.  He accomplished both goals with this reader.</p>


	<p>Unlike your physics classes, which featured a lot of sleeping on your book, this one starts on your stove.  A physicist named Max Planck back in 1900 tried to figure out why your stove glows red when it gets really hot.   The most convincing theories concerning how objects behaved when heated in the Newtonian physics predicted that it would be blue, not red.  The answers he came back with led directly to Einstein&#8217;s theory of special relativity.  On your stove!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not going to summarize the book; I feel you should read it yourself.  It&#8217;s not long, challenging, or expensive.  I will say that it is not an argument, or at least it doesn&#8217;t appear to be one to me.  It appears to be a history, indicating there&#8217;s no other way you <strong>could</strong> logically process the information.  I was very impressed with this, and I wish more books were that way.  I guess that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m reading non-fiction these days!</p>


	<p>I was initially very concerned, because the &#8220;Mass Market Paperback&#8221; places this book in the New Age section, which evokes things that I&#8217;d rather not have mixed too closely with this book.  Fortunately, I find his touch with this topic perfectly acceptable, and maybe even likely to intrigue some people who might not have started reading the book with an interest in Eastern schools of thought.  None of these references occur in the middle of describing experiments or anything like that.  He merely points out (and not as often as you might expect) how the results of these experiments might be interpreted by the Eastern viewpoint.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t possibly resist some spoilers here.  I can only hope that seeing where you end up will make you want to buy it.</p>


	<p>Bell&#8217;s Theorem states that on a subatomic level, the principle of local causes does not hold.  The alternative to Bell&#8217;s theorem is denying that quantum physics predicts the results of experiments, which is kind of like saying that the free dummy from that <a href="http://www.quoteworld.org/author.php?thetext=Jack+Handey+%5BDeep+Thoughts%5D">Deep Thought By Jack Handey</a> wouldn&#8217;t even fall to the ground at all.</p>


	<p>So, what does that mean, that business about local causes? It means we have a contradiction for which there are four possible resolutions.  The first, is you are free to logically believe that no models of reality are possible.  This was the first thing that physicists thought, and it doesn&#8217;t exactly appear to be the way things are working out.</p>


	<p>Now the interesting stuff.  <strong>Locality</strong> can fail.  Imagine you&#8217;re&#8230; wherever you are and I&#8217;m&#8230; wherever I am.  On a sufficiently small level, <strong>things that I do here can affect things that you see there</strong>.  Instantly.  Even though light itself wouldn&#8217;t be able to make the journey instantaneously, somehow these little subatomic particles are making it happen, doing their thing, acting like they were right in sync with each other.  Incidentally, it also wouldn&#8217;t make a difference if I was on Mars, or in another galaxy.</p>


	<p>The second choice, if you don&#8217;t like locality failing, is <strong>contrafactual definiteness</strong> failing.  This has two subparts: contrafactualness and definiteness.  If <strong>contrafactualness</strong> fails, then <strong>you have no free will</strong>.  Everything you do and everything that happens was &#8220;put into motion&#8221; before the universe began.  It&#8217;s even stronger than this, as a matter of fact.  A belief in the failure of contrafactualness would logically entail <strong>believing that the entire universe couldn&#8217;t have happened any differently</strong> that everything from the big bang to the very second you&#8217;re reading this was predictable given the complete set of rules at the beginning of the game.  This doesn&#8217;t seem plausable to me, to say nothing of the limited appeal.</p>


	<p>The third choice, and maybe the wildest, is that <strong>definiteness</strong> fails.  This would mean entail a belief in the <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/everett/everett.htm">Many Words Theory</a>.  In short, it says that every possible action is occuring in some branch of the universe.  In other words, there&#8217;s a universe where, instead of thinking about translating this entire post into <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=l33t%20sp34k">l33t sp34k</a>, I actually do it.  Wait, there, I thought about wiggling my nose, there&#8217;s another one now.  And one for each word I might have misspelled or typo made while typing this.  That&#8217;s pretty mindblowing.</p>


	<p>So, out of the four beliefs you could choose, there&#8217;s one that most physicists would rule out: the &#8220;no models&#8221; one.  So if you believe in free will, you&#8217;re probably anticipating the discovery of wild connections between the quanta which comprise all of us or the discovery of an infinite number of alternate realities.</p>


	<p>But don&#8217;t just take my word for it.  <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055326382X/jimvanfleetco-20">Find out yourself!</a></p>
