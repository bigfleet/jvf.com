  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past couple of weekends, it&#8217;s been hard for me to keep my spirits up.  I don&#8217;t have very many friends left in town that I see all that often, and I&#8217;m really getting tired of hours and hours by myself in my apartment.</p>


	<p>So this weekend, I&#8217;m headed up to Austin to stay with Eric Furbish, a friend of mine who&#8217;s living there.  (I&#8217;d link to his homepage but it&#8217;s <strong>naked!</strong>)  Eric, for goodness sakes, hide that directory listing with a web page.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll drop a line detailing what we&#8217;ll get into.</p>


	<p>Also, I&#8217;m adding a new poll having to do with some questions about the site.  It&#8217;s really breaking my heart that three people have voted in the poll, one of them being myself.  I&#8217;ll hope it&#8217;s because you found the poll topic entirely uninspiring rather than no one&#8217;s visiting any more.  <i>(sigh)</i></p>

  <div class="entry-content">The plot begins when a news anchor has a bit of a breakdown when he&#8217;s sacked and announces that he will commit suicide on the program in two weeks time.  Conveniently, there&#8217;s a shareholder meeting the next night which pisses the anchor&#8217;s boss off enough to let the maniac back on the air, and people start watching the show.  This is, without a doubt, the strongest arc of any of the multiple things going on in this movie, the only one, in my opinion, which sustains the full weight that this move feels it has.  I won&#8217;t get into what happens, but I will say that everything having to do with this story line I felt was very impressive.
<table border="1" align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
<table align="right"><tr><td align="center"><img src="http://www.uni-television.com/jerry/resources/right.tv.ani.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>This is the best picture I could find without having to pay $9.95</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
There are two major subplots.  The first deals with the head of the news division and Fay Dunaway, a prototype of the programming director who brought you Jerry Springer.  The second concerns the Dunaway character&#8217;s involvement with a terrorist group that she puts on the air.

	<p>The first I find completely unconvincing.  We don&#8217;t see any reason why these two should have any chemistry at all, or maybe I missed that three minutes.  I feel it drags down the rest of the movie while not providing any real substantive value, besides letting the news director get inside for some body shots on the mentality creating this kind of television.  I found it grating and distracting.</p>


	<p>The second showcases a communist radical who does quite a good capatalist impression once the money shows up.  This subplot fares a lot better.</p>


	<p>I feel like a review of this movie without a discussion among other people who watched it is not quite complete.  Most of the reviews you&#8217;ll see elsewhere are unswervingly high.  I still recommend the movie, simply because it deals with an interesting topic in an interesting way.  Disagreeing with its message, or not finding the characters really all that credible is another issue.</p>


	<p>The movie is loud, and attacks in every direction.  That means that sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses, and sometimes you&#8217;re wondering what the hell is happening!  For it&#8217;s time, the movie would have to be considered unbelievable.  The fact that it could see what was happening so far in advance (a bit like the psychic they put on the news show) is worthy of the highest commendation.  The only way it retains this kind of value today is if you watch with other people and talk about it.  The movie&#8217;s messages are simply too scattered to put them all together.  I give it a <strong>7.2/10</strong> and add a bonus point if you know what TV was like in those days.</p>

	<p>I installed a poll subsystem, you should see that over on the right.  The first question has to do with the linked article from <span class="caps">ESPN</span>.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I root for womankind against the oppresive elements of mankind all the time, but isn&#8217;t <a href="http://espn.go.com/wnba/news/2003/0722/1584313.html" target="_blank">this</a> taking it a little far?  Leave a comment, vote, whatever.</p>


I&#8217;m scared enough of the <span class="caps">RIAA I</span> took down my music list.  I&#8217;ve been ready to stop trading for a short time, actually, even without their subpoenas.  This reminds me.  There&#8217;s only two reasons to take Latin:  it makes learning any other language a piece of cake, and you can spell words like &#8220;subpoena&#8221; without having to look them up.  I invited a guest author to speak on the topic, maybe he&#8217;ll restore my courage.

I&#8217;m about half way through my next book, look for that review before next week is out.  It&#8217;s been every bit as good as <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">Wu Li</a>, but  it&#8217;s two or three times as long.  And I can&#8217;t tell you what it is, it&#8217;s a secret.

	<p>I was so stressed about what to do with my Friday night, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier that I spend it talking to friends and getting a couple of things up here.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, the pictures.  I don&#8217;t pretend to have a full grasp of what we&#8217;re doing in Iraq, but I have some theories.  If we do find Saddam, GW is going to have a hell of a time convincing America that our boys still belong over there.  Also, no matter if you agree with our policy or not, why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://www.uso.org/pubs/8_18_23.cfm">donate to the <span class="caps">USO</span></a>.  They don&#8217;t even get to phone home for free, people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I finally did watch it, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I suppose that I was wrong not to give <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Crowe,+Cameron">Cameron Crowe</a> the benefit of the doubt, because even if his films haven&#8217;t been works of art, they have never been <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120915">trash</a>, either.</p>


	<p>What you get with Say Anything is a pleasant, little high-school drama.  You have a sensitive-not-paralyzed young man charming a beautiful, intelligent, yet curiously not universally lusted over young lady.  It fit into my framework of the way things like this go.  No spoilers, but the interplay between the men in her life and her gravitation towards them seems to be no surprise.</p>


	<p>Still, I just don&#8217;t know what to say about this movie.  It should be required viewing for sophomores in high-school, but if you&#8217;re already older than that, there&#8217;s really no point that I can see.  Perhaps if you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> a nice-type guy, you could see what kind of reaction your girl has to Lloyd.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got to wrap this up, because of time constraints.  It&#8217;s a pleasant movie, which you might like watching as a matinee while you do something else that&#8217;s important.  Like, say, I did.  Otherwise, start it as a <strong>10/10</strong> if you&#8217;re 14, and substract half a point a year until you hit college, then give it a one point deduction then, leaving a <strong>7/10</strong></p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It never threatens to become <a HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0339034">typical romantic fare</a>, because the movie has something called <a HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=scope">scope.</a>  The movie starts with a focus on the main character as a child.  As most young boys do, he likes to do what he wants, and not what he&#8217;s told.  What he wants to do is go to the movies.  He strikes up a friendship with the projectionist, and ends up becoming his protégé.  These early scenes are very well done.  The characters are well played, seeming natural and the friendship seems genuine.  Perhaps even more impressive is the <strong>scene</strong> which is laid.  The town (forgot the name) is just as much a character in the story as anyone with lines.  You feel the community in this town, and it&#8217;s amazing the depth they create with only the scenes in the theatre and a few others as raw material.</p>


	<p>The main character becomes a young man, who is taken with a new girl, the daughter of a prominent banker.  His attempts to charm her are charming, and atypical.  We see many slipups, but he never given up his attempts, no matter how grevious his missteps.  Eventually, he wins the girl&#8217;s heart.</p>


	<p>After that is when the movie really starts to get going.  She faces the prospects of having to leave for a university, as well as being betrothed to another different man by her father.  How does it all turn out?  And how does the projectionist fit into their story?  You&#8217;ll have to watch to find out, and believe me, it&#8217;s worth it.</p>


	<p>I feel the real highlight of this film, though, is the power with which it presents a homecoming after a long abscence.  I haven&#8217;t left home for anything like the 30 years which the narrator uses to build his career as (what else?) a film director.  But when he comes back, he is laid bare.  He had expected his years away to make him stronger, to make him able to face some of the things that happened to him, to dull the pain.  In this town, though, he&#8217;s the same person he ever was, like the intervening years had never happened, or they had happened to someone else.  He doesn&#8217;t just say these things either, you feel them.  He enters his old room, watches his old movies&#8230;  It&#8217;s devestating to watch a successful man become a strange sort of shell for a love-struck boy.</p>


	<p>This is a bittersweet movie.  It doesn&#8217;t seem like anyone gets exactly what they deserve.  The very end of the movie, however, is a perfect conclusion, wrapping up all the main themes and giving a ride down memory lane, as well.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s difficult to know what to deduct for from this movie.  It&#8217;s long, but that shouldn&#8217;t necessarily take away from your score.  I&#8217;ll call it a one point deduction for replay value;  I don&#8217;t feel a paticular need to see the movie again.  But this is an excellent move, one that earns every point of its <strong>9/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I sent around the first message to most everybody who might be interested in this page just because I&#8217;m doing it.  Eventually, maybe some other people will be fooled into thinking it has some kind of merit or something.</p>


	<p>Anyway, my goal is to make it to your bookmarks and actually have you come back every once in awhile.  So check things out, come back to this thread and leave a comment letting me know what you&#8217;d like to see more of!</p>


	<p>Hope you enjoy looking around.</p>
