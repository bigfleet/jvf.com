<dt>Football</dt>
<dd><p>I&#8217;m 8-0 straight up in the playoffs, so far.  That&#8217;s intriguing, but I have absolutely no idea who will win the Super Bowl.  I&#8217;m picking the Eagles and the Pats to advance to Houston, but I absolutely cannot pick that game.  Should be fun to watch, though!</p></dd>
<dt>The Job</dt>
<dd><p>I wanted to put together a good week on the software development project.  This was the first time I was putting together real pages that are going to be used in the project using <a href="http://www.salmonllc.com/"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a> and <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>.</p>
<p>I was on fire.  Everything I tried worked, more or less after the first compile.  The pages fell and I was able to get one day ahead of the best-case scenario I laid out for myself.  I already gave that day up to work on the actual consulting gig a little.</p>
<p>I also got exposed to <a href="http://www.httpunit.com">HttpUnit</a>, a unit testing framework for web applications.  The JUnit framework doesn&#8217;t exactly to wrap your tests around the pages in the right way, but HttpUnit fits just right.  It&#8217;s easily integrated, uses an <span class="caps">API</span>, and looks like it behaves the way you want.  It&#8217;ll be a big time saver for me if it works out.</p>
<p>Last thing about work&#8212;if I ever get a chance to fully work out what exactly I need from <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> to make it play exactly how I want, then I will be able to <span class="caps">REALLY</span> cook.  <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> integrates about halfway with Hibernate, and if the other half ever falls, that will really be something.  I know it&#8217;s within my reach, but I think I&#8217;ll really try to target any new additions for a 2.0 release, rather than doing such <strong>huge</strong> refactoring in the middle of this project.</p></dd>
<dt>The Plan</dt>
<dd><p>I got my behavior modification spreadsheet all worked out, and today was the first day.  I plan on sharing the highlights of the results every week, so  I&#8217;m at the very least not to have those stretches where nothing even shows up on the page.</p></dd>
<dt>Mission Accomplished</dt>
<dd><p>I got to talk to Brady in the middle of the week.  It was really great, but it did make me realize how lonely I&#8217;ve gotten up here.  Football is too interesting to skip it now, but it will be interesting when I get my weekends completely freed up.  Am I going to do anything about it?  Will anything that I do about it actually work?  Who knows?</p></dd>

What I find most impressive and interesting about Powers is that his books deal with real science in intelligent ways.  One of the reasons The Matrix was so exciting was that there were so many interesting ideas brought up, all of which could pass an initial quality or (in)sanity check.  They didn&#8217;t even get through Reloaded before their contrivances lost all touch with real scientific thought.  Powers not only avoids these traps, he makes the science dance.  He marries the language, the ideas with his own.  He is constantly reaching for the frontier, but never violates the bounds of what&#8217;s real and observable&#8212;for whatever that&#8217;s worth.  When a writer has earned credibility, it makes the flights of fancy so much more enjoyable.

Since I&#8217;ve already broken out one movie comparison, I&#8217;ll do another.  In Adaptation, the writer puts himself in his screenplay and refers to other work that he&#8217;s done.  But it&#8217;s not to enhance the work, it&#8217;s to distract from it.  It is the story, something about the dangers and/or inevitability of selling out.  To tell you the truth, I had really stopped caring.  If you&#8217;re going to be clever about your own cleverness, you better be damn good at it.  I enjoyed parts of the movie, but ultimately, I found it wanting.  Watch as I sneak in a <strong>6.2/10</strong> for it.

Powers writes himself in as the main character.  He refers to all of his previous works, describing the framework that they came from, within the context of the story he&#8217;s telling.  At once, the words and stories are affecting.  I saw books that I had read and loved in a new frame, with a new appreciation.  Then, you start to wonder if it&#8217;s actually true, if this book was an exorcism.  There are so many different ways to tie the events together, you&#8217;re starting to wonder about your own perceptual matrix, and how Helen (that&#8217;s the neural net) could ever keep up.

	<p>She can&#8217;t, but this book can (and does) make my top ten.  I can&#8217;t think of any deductions besides that fact that I still enjoyed The Goldbug Variations more.  Probably just because there were twice as many pages.  You won&#8217;t regret spending time on them.  I&#8217;m going to give it a <strong>9.7/10</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The show itself was tight.  Skillz was awesome, the highlight of the night.  I would jump at the chance to go see Skillz as a headliner.  When he stepped on stage to rap that first joint, it was <i>tiiiight</i>, and the CD&#8217;s I picked up of his seem to indicate that he has the material to pull it off.  Rumor is that he&#8217;s leaving Rawkus as well.</p>


	<p>Jean Grae was incredible as well, I got albums from them both.  J-Live was awesome, but I have his rekkids.  Vast Aire had a sore throat and couldn&#8217;t go.  Everyone on OK Player forums was talking up Little Brother.  They were enjoyable and all that, and they did their jobs, but I didn&#8217;t feel it all that much.  Everyone talks bad about the Def Jux performance.  Sure, it wasn&#8217;t the same crunk level as everything else&#8212;but I guess these people are used to dancing for three hours straight.  I have to have a little bit of down time myself.</p>


	<p>As for my plans to tape, I at least have all the gear now, and I actually asked the sound guys about it.  I forgot my permission slip from <a href="http://btat.wagnerone.com"><span class="caps">BTAT</span></a>, though, so that was as far as I got.  Someday&#8212;maybe My Morning Jacket at the Canal Club at the end of the month.</p>

But that doesn&#8217;t stop him from getting it on with three different people during the book, and that&#8217;s not even all.  His grandparents were brother and sister, and they bump uglies on frame in this one as well.

	<p>It&#8217;s not all about sex, but that&#8217;s definitely the main topic.  He&#8217;s come a long way from The Virgin Suicides (on my all-time top ten, by the way) where you felt like the trees weren&#8217;t the only things rotting from the inside.  All that subtle unpleasantness is gone for this story.  We&#8217;ll be getting all the unpleasantness front and center this time.</p>


	<p>The narrator is a wonderful creation, and the characters seem as real as any you&#8217;ll encounter.  You&#8217;re introduced to him, but you grow up with her.  And they&#8217;ve both seen a lot.</p>


	<p>This book is exceptional, and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone with an inclination to read for pleasure.  My only complaint was that especially by the end, we&#8217;ve had enough coincidental, dramatic happenings that the end seems more implausable than it should.  I give it a .4 deduction, because it was worse than <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000074.php">The Return of the King</a>, but just barely.</p>

<li>Going to a show in DC tomorrow night!  <a href="http://www.definitivejux.net/tours/archives/okay_player_tour.html">Check it out!</a></li>
<li>I payed off my Discover card a couple of days ago.  I&#8217;m only a month or so from positive net worth for the first time since my junior year at Rice!</li>
<li><span class="caps">FSU</span> could miss a thousand field goals against Miami, and I&#8217;d never get tired of it</li>
<li>I know I&#8217;m totally lagging in the communications aspect with everyone, but it seems like I&#8217;ve been so busy.  I know I&#8217;m not always, but it seems like it.</li>
<li>Due to an ill-advised move back to Windows 2000 on my desktop, I&#8217;ve lost a good deal of data.  This normally does not happen to me.  My Eudora mailboxes seem very corrupted, and that&#8217;s simply not acceptible!  I&#8217;ll have to correct it at some point, but I&#8217;m thinking about going all webmail.  If you&#8217;ve done so with success, let me know</li>
<li>Working out in the morning has been working like a charm.  That part, at least.  I&#8217;m very sore today, though&#8212;it&#8217;s been about a month since I got in there for the weightlifting.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make it tomorrow, maybe I won&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s definitely becoming a part of my day.</li>
<li>I only have two resolutions: stick to my behavior plan (don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll see it soon) and lose my gut.  Maybe I&#8217;d feel good enough to try to make some friends here without the <strong>belly!</strong>  Your days are numbered, pauncho.</li>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The request for the wardrobe came about when I discovered that I had two shirts that were the same.  Exactly the same.  And I had been wearing them for months, without even realizing.  Unforgivable!  &#8220;When did this happen?&#8221; I thought.  Booney would never have let something like that happen on her watch.</p>


	<p>Anyway, the new threads are mostly from <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com/eb/default.asp">Eddie Bauer</a>.  I&#8217;ve gotten many clothes from them over the years, mostly because they have a wide selection in Tall.  (Also, when did Structure turn into Express Men and <a href="http://www.expressfashion.com/style/must_haves/tops_m.jsp?navid=1.2.2.1.0.0">start to suck</a>?  How come they didn&#8217;t run it by me?)</p>


	<p>Anyway, the content is mostly long-sleeve woven button-downs, suitable for dress or casual.  It reminds me of Faykus&#8217;s wardrobe, only maybe with more stripes&#8212;and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen him wear any sweaters.  Not that any of you have seen <strong>me</strong> wear more than one or two maybe.  But now I have some very nice ones that are actually appealing to wear.  I actually like the idea, since apparently the idea of what a &#8220;sweater&#8221; is has changed since I was eight, and had to wear them to church.  They&#8217;re a lot thinner!</p>


	<p>A lot of accessories, too.  New pairs of comfortable dress shoes, gloves, sunglasses, etc.  I can appreciate anything that makes me feel a bit like I&#8217;m a new person.  Even though it&#8217;s plainly obvious to everyone, I sometimes forget.</p>


	<p>The knives are from J.A. Henckel.  Erin&#8217;s mom took back the ones she bought for her&#8212;who could blame her!  I survived my semester in the one-bedroom down on Brompton with just a utility knife.  Have you ever cut bread with a utility knife?  Not pretty.  So anyway, score that one for the new place&#8212;whenever <strong>that</strong> happens.  We&#8217;re having enough problems just getting the basement finished.</p>


	<p>Christmas Eve netted me some neat books, including some which you&#8217;ll sure to see reviewed here shortly.  Free time has been a lot harder to come by, lately.  I did get some <span class="caps">DVD</span>&#8217;s as well, like Simpson&#8217;s Third Season (classic) and Family Guy third season (I didn&#8217;t even have the first two&#8212;what gives, Ib?)</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s all for this post!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  2003 was the worst year ever.  While, technically, Erin died in 2002, 99.9% of dealing with it happened in 2003.  And now Jesse is gone.  We went to war.  Tennessee lost the Peach Bowl, got shafted and had to go back again.</p>


	<p>So I&#8217;m eager to start a New Year, to have things start to get better.  But how can it be happy?  Maybe it&#8217;s just one of those moods for me, but I&#8217;ve been highly productive the past couple of days, and normally that makes me pretty sunny.</p>


	<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll <strong>never</strong> be happy about the New Year rolling around, just because of what happened last time.  I heard that &#8220;it&#8217;s not the letting go that hurts, it&#8217;s the holding on that hurts.&#8221;  This is, frankly, a load of crap.  The fact is that they both hurt, but maybe it depends on who you are.</p>


	<p>I heard the holidays are supposed to be bad anyway.  I&#8217;m just lucky I had a chance to be with my family.  Alone?  Yeah, that wouldn&#8217;t have gone well.</p>


	<p>So, anyway, I&#8217;m going to do my best to be super-productive in 2004.  For me, anyway.  I&#8217;ve been working on a system to manage my own behavior in a way that I&#8217;ll be likely to use it instead of just agonize over it and eventually discard it.  Part of what I get points for is sharing it with everyone here, so you know you are all in my thoughts.</p>


	<p>Drinking didn&#8217;t even work for me today.  <i>sigh</i></p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hit town and picked up my rental car.  This is only the second time I&#8217;ve ever rented a car, and the first one was because I backed my van into a pole while having a low-level nervous breakdown.  This time I got to feel like an adult.  Coming into town on business!  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/quotes">Our little baby&#8217;s all growns up</a> was all I could think.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I picked up a Accord LX for my mid-size deal.  Not bad, huh!  I did get a little miffed at Enterprise&#8217;s web system for not charging me the $10 a day for being 24 even though I told them that before.</p>


	<p>The bed over at the La Quinta Astrodome is probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I&#8217;ve ever slept in, if not the best.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve not even left yet and I&#8217;ve eaten at <a href="http://www.freebirds.com/">Freebird&#8217;s</a>, the Hobbit Hole&#8212;er, Cafe, Rudyard&#8217;s, Rucci&#8217;s, Two Rows (more on that in a moment)&#8230;  One thing you have to say about Houston is they have delicious restaurants.</p>


	<p>At Two Rows, where I was meeting with Jordan Faykus, we saw Jamie Sharper and Kailee Wong from the Texans (bringing back Madden &#8216;04 memories for me&#8230;.  mmmmmm) and  <a href="http://www.movieprop.com/tvandmovie/savedbythebell/acslater.htm">A.C. Slater</a> was with them.  Unbelievable!  Of course, his real name is Mario Lopez.  Who cares about that, though?</p>


	<p>I got to run around with Jordan Pearce the other night, and that was a lot of fun.  <a href="http://www.rudyards.com/">Rudz</a> for drinks, West Alabama Ice House for drinks (also featuring the first time I walked out on a tab&#8212;whoops!), Rol-In for drinks&#8230;  I think you&#8217;re getting the picture.  That&#8217;s how we ended up at Rucci&#8217;s at 2 AM, and thanks to my magical &#8220;water and pill&#8221; regime, no hangover for Sunday.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also gotten quite a bit of work done, creating a fairly complete master development plan for the 360 feedback project, and having a good requirements meeting on that very issue today.  Even so, though, getting reimbursed for the trip to just have that meeting seems like a big win for me.  I certainly have enjoyed it.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting a Chai tea and posting on my blog from a coffee shop now.  I mean, what next?  Getting a beret?  Starting a poetry notebook?</p>


	<p>About the only thing I&#8217;m feeling bad about is that I haven&#8217;t called Jennifer yet about Jess, but that&#8217;ll change soon, I&#8217;m sure.  But it&#8217;s been a happy conclusion to the holiday preliminaries.</p>

<time datetime="2003-12-18T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 18<span>th</span>, 2003</time> - 
        


        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I work for a company called <span class="caps">OPGI</span>.  Once I get a chance to actually populate the website with some interesting information, I&#8217;ll provide a link but for now, it&#8217;s a shitty page I threw together in a couple of hours.  They do a lot of work similar to what my dad did when he still ran the <a href="http://www.vanfleetgroup.com/">The Van Fleet Group</a>.</p>


	<p>The company has its operating partner, Chuck Gibbs, at the middle of everything.  He has a ton of projects going all around the world&#8212;he circumnavigated the globe in the two weeks after I was hired.  There are consultants working for him on all these different projects, and he&#8217;s just beginning to experiment with a small group of young employees.</p>


	<p>They don&#8217;t have any technical employees, so I&#8217;m the first one of those.  This puts me in a position to do the three things I&#8217;m working on currently:</p>


<dl>
<dt>Internal electronic communications</dt>
<dd>

	<p>Chuck is still using his <span class="caps">AOL</span> address, although that won&#8217;t last for much longer.  The company has no website, no e-mail addresses, no cohesive feel for working with it.  I&#8217;m going to be addressing these issues into the future, but it&#8217;s likely to be a bit of a low priority.</p>


</dd>
<dt>Web application</dt>
<dd>

	<p>The web application is something I&#8217;ve been working on since the <a href="http://www.bmtmicro.com"><span class="caps">BMT</span> Micro, Inc.</a> days.  I&#8217;m trying to develop an entire development process starting from the moment you&#8217;re talking to regular people about what they want the application to do, up until the point where you deploy it to the web and write the invoice.  <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/031210.html"><span class="caps">CTC</span></a>, baby!  If it works, it&#8217;s really something that could give me an actual edge in the business world.  I&#8217;m very excited about working in this area.</p>


</dd>
<dt>Consulting</dt>
<dd>

	<p>It was somewhat of a surprise to find out that one of the people Chuck works with here in Richmond asked for me to come check out their department and review their processes.  So now I play two roles here, listening to technical issues raised by the <span class="caps">OPGI</span> team and making recommendations about the development process at the company.  I mean, just because I have no experience, what should that matter?</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a tough gig with a lot of ups and downs, but it&#8217;s exciting.  And since it&#8217;s ultimately something I&#8217;ll have to be quite comfortable with if I&#8217;m going to be a <span class="caps">CEO</span> myself someday, I might as well start getting experience now.</p>


</dd>
</dl>

	<p>Something else, huh?  There&#8217;s a lot of chances for me to learn new things and he wants me to spend time working on <span class="caps">CISV</span> issues, as well.  I couldn&#8217;t really draw up anything better for myself, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
