  <div class="entry-content"><p>After spending more and more time with <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>, I&#8217;m more convinced then ever that I need to make the switch for my personal space.  I&#8217;m getting serious this time.  The blog is turning into a <span class="caps">CMS</span> and taking over <a href="http:///www.jimvanfleet.com/">my main domain</a>, which hasn&#8217;t been touched in many, many years.  I&#8217;m working with Mephisto for <a href="http://www.cvreg.org"><span class="caps">CVREG</span></a>, and at work with <a href="http://www.planixonline.com/">Planix</a>.  (Expect more about that application later.)  Custom designs adorn them both, and my mind is sort of racing anyway&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to get carried away, but we&#8217;ll see what I can make happen.  At any rate, please forgive the time lapse between posts as I prepare for tectonic shifts in my hosting arrangements.</p>


	<p>Pursuant to the above, are there any web designers out there willing to barter work product?  I can train you to be truly dangerous to your market with Ruby on Rails.  (Dare to dream, Jim)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Megan and I returned this afternoon from a trip to DC to see <a href="http://www.massiveattack.co.uk/">Massive Attack</a> at the <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30 Club</a>.  My good friend Bill was able to come as well.  We were both pretty psyched that they were even playing in the general area, since they don&#8217;t tour stateside that often.  The show totally ruled.  No surprise there.</p>


	<p>It was even better than that, because of our stay at the <a href="http://www.hotelhelix.com/index.html">Hotel Helix</a> and our dinner at Duke&#8217;s Lounge.  Duke&#8217;s has an excellent Cosmopolitan, and we are planning big things for the Hotel Helix.  My sister absolutely has to see it.  It&#8217;s so incredibly her style I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>


	<p>There.  I finally posted about something more or less when it happened.  I still behind, but whatever.</p>

<time datetime="2006-09-20T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 20<span>th</span>, 2006</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> longer than I have been using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org/">Ubuntu</a>, and only one of them has been longer than a year, so this is a de facto Newbie&#8217;s guide, but hopefully you&#8217;ll find it useful.</p>


	<p>After you&#8217;re done (and it should take you no more than about 10 minutes), you&#8217;ll be able to get a Rails app using <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> created and running on your local machine using <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/index.html">Mongrel</a>.  <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> fans, feel free to use the common parts to form your own guide.</p>


	<h2>The Prerequisites</h2>


	<h3>Repository Selection</h3>


	<p>If you have already enabled the security and universe repositories, you can skip this step.  I am a big copy-and-paste guy, but this step works better with point-and-click.</p>


	<p>Under <strong>System</strong> on your Gnome panel, under the <strong>Administration</strong> menu, select <strong>Synaptic Package Manager</strong>.</p>


	<p>In Synaptic, select the <strong>Repositories</strong> item under the <strong>Settings</strong> menu.  Enable the &#8216;universe&#8217; repositories for both Dapper <span class="caps">LTS</span> and Dapper <span class="caps">LTS</span> Updates.  (I have enabled multiverse as well, I believe that&#8217;s optional.)</p>


	<p>Also, you&#8217;ll need to enable the Security Updates repository, as it&#8217;s not enabled by default.  I enable all the security update repositories, but again, enabling the multiverse should be optional.</p>


	<p>Quit the application, since we can do the rest using the terminal.</p>


	<p>If you use <span class="caps">KDE</span>, you&#8217;re going to have to figure this out on your own.  If you favor the command line for this part as well, you&#8217;ll be editing your /etc/apt/sources.list file as described at <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_add_extra_repositories">the Ubuntu guide</a></p>


	<h3>Update Your Package Database</h3>


Ensure that your system is up-to-date by issuing the following commands.  Enabling the security repository should mean that you have quite a lot to upgrade on top of a base installation.
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

	<h2>The Main Course</h2>


	<h3>Preparation for Gem Installation</h3>


	<p>Ruby and C have some close ties, as languages go.  Some Ruby gems that we&#8217;ll be installing need to do some compilation and installation, so we&#8217;ll prepare ourselves with the basics.</p>


Issue the following command in your terminal.
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential automake subversion
</code></pre>

	<h3>Installing Apache 2, MySQL 5, and <span class="caps">PHP 4</span></h3>


If you need <span class="caps">PHP5</span>, this isn&#8217;t the guide for you.  The only reason that I&#8217;m installing <span class="caps">PHP</span> at all is so I have access to <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a>.
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install apache2 php4 mysql-client mysql-server phpmyadmin libapache2-mod-php4 libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php4-mysql libmysqlclient15-dev
sudo a2enmod proxy
</code></pre>

	<h4>Why mod_proxy?</h4>


	<p>I have a <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/confluence">Confluence</a> installation on my home machine that I use in conjunction with my <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS</a> account.  Getting that traffic to flow through your router is outside the scope of this guide, but I need to proxy my incoming <span class="caps">HTTP</span> traffic.  Hence, mod_proxy is in the guide!</p>


	<h3>Installing Ruby</h3>


The gems that you&#8217;ll install later require the Ruby development package.
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install ruby irb ri rdoc ruby1.8-dev
</code></pre>

	<h3>Installing Ruby Gems</h3>


	<p>You&#8217;ll appreciate not having to depend on Ubuntu and upstream supplying you with the latest version of RubyGems, especially when it plays so nicely with the system you&#8217;ve set up so far.</p>


<pre><code>
wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/11289/rubygems-0.9.0.tgz
tar zxvf rubygems-0.9.0.tgz
cd rubygems-0.9.0
sudo ruby setup.rb
</code></pre>

	<h3>Installing the Gems</h3>


<pre><code>
sudo gem install rails mysql mongrel --include-dependencies
</code></pre>

	<p>Rails and Mongrel have dependencies.  mysql and mongrel have different versions you&#8217;ll have to choose from.  If this is a development box, why not choose the newest of each?  If it&#8217;s a production box, I make no claims that any particular version of a any gem is production ready. Make sure to pick the &#8220;ruby&#8221; versions, since you&#8217;re on Dapper.</p>


	<h2>Done!</h2>


Check out something like <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>, <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a>, or issue your standard rails command along with a
<pre><code>
mongrel_rails start
</code></pre>

	<p>and that should do the trick.</p>


	<h2>Author&#8217;s Note on Lighttpd and Mongrel</h2>


	<p>Many users have used lighttpd as a replacement for Apache because of the latter&#8217;s support of FastCGI, uh&#8230; leaves something to be desired.  I&#8217;ve had to learn how to use it as part of the long-time recommended stack over a <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>, where they know their Rails.  I still use it there, but, to me, Mongrel is far superior, especially for a development environment.  It&#8217;s like Webrick, only it appears to be more than suitable for production use.  Add the ease of installation factor, and it&#8217;s a no-brainer for me to endorse.  As always, <span class="caps">YMMV</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is contuining in my now-current tradition of posting about events several months later.</p>


	<p>The annual family vacation to Wilmington, NC this year was a lot of fun.  Not only did I <a href="lifes-true-joys">get engaged</a>, but we played tennis, got to the beach, watched some movies, ate some great food and played some cards.  I also got to visit Brady down in South Carolina.  We really enjoyed our trip down to South Carolina for her wedding a couple of weeks ago as well.</p>


	<p>The only troubling thought was the realization that even after living in Wilmington for about two years, when I come back in another two, the only thing I may know about the town is where most of the roads go.  Established restaurants, cornerstones of the town, are opening up sister restaurants, moving, or closing down.  Movie theaters are closing down.  They&#8217;re building new roads that circle the town, making everything more convenient, but I felt like a tool when I took us on a 45 minute drive that could have taken 15.</p>


	<p>I have never really cared if any town has changed, as long as I like the changes.  (Most of the changes in Wilmington are for the better.)  But in this case, I still wish those changes had never happened.  At some point, I&#8217;ll look back and any trace of the life Erin and I led will be gone.  Memory only helps so much.  It&#8217;s a process&#8212;I&#8217;m still getting used to it.</p>

	<li><a href="http://uvacows.livejournal.com/">Megan&#8217;s blogging</a> a lot more than I am now.  How embarrassing!  But I couldn&#8217;t be happier at the prospect, since we&#8217;re already talking about how differently we value and treat our memories.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>We&#8217;ve decided on a couple of wedding details.  We&#8217;re getting married at the Dominion Club here in Richmond.  Megan has already bought her dress, and my sister has already bought one of the bridesmaid dresses, since one of the colors has also been selected.  We&#8217;re working on getting the budget for the food put together, then a lot of other pieces will fall into place.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve fiddled around with the blog software that powers this blog, and, as much as I&#8217;d like to say otherwise, I&#8217;m likely to be on this software for the near future.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am very happy having moved my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/06/09/making-tracks">Tracks installation</a> to my friend <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/">Ryan&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.gtdtracks.com/">GTDTracks</a> service.  It&#8217;s very affordable, considering I was spending much more than its monthly cost trying to keep it running on my own machine at home.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>My <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/confluence">favorite Wiki</a> is available for free to non-profits.  I&#8217;ve chosen <a href="http://www.rose-hosting.com/">Rose Hosting</a> since they offered Debian Sarge at a reasonable monthly rate.  Hopefully, <span class="caps">CISV</span> will finally have a wiki that won&#8217;t scare people and that can keep out the thugs.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m hopeful that the <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/"><span class="caps">CISV USA</span></a> website redesign project will begin relatively soon.  We&#8217;re waiting on a design from International.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve announced that I&#8217;m in the most fun fantasy league I&#8217;ve ever been in.  I&#8217;m also doing quite alright.  My goal was to score 55 points (in a 10-team league, that&#8217;s moderately above average) and to finish &#8220;in the pack&#8221;.  I&#8217;m a little behind that, currently, but at one point I was in third place.  I&#8217;ve got a better team for the future than I thought I would have.  My off-season will now be visited by monsters.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I had a great time during a visit with <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/">Jeremy</a> last week.  I have been a bit concerned at various times during our past discussions that attempting to merge our outlooks would result in more heat than light, but now I&#8217;m more hopeful that we&#8217;ll both learn a lot from the process.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am, of course, salivating at the prospect of another football season.  Especially one where I&#8217;ll get to see my first <span class="caps">UVA</span> Cavaliers game.  I&#8217;ll be at the Thursday night game, Oct. 19, against the North Carolina Tar Heels.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Last night&#8217;s UT-Florida game is just another example of why I love college football.  Dramatic, huge momentum changes, great football played by young men on both sides, lots of mental toughness, and a bunch of great stories.  I loved it, even if UT did take the loss.</li>
	</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While we were <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/09/17/stranger-in-a-familiar-land">on vacation</a>, our yard was magically transformed from one with builder&#8217;s grade holly bushes and juniper stumps to one with two full beds around the two main edges of the house, a new tree, and new beds under the existing tree and by our mailbox.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s been exciting for many reasons.</p>


	<p>First, I finally feel like the neighborhood has evidence that we care about how our house looks.  Those stumps have been out in the yard for about a year, and no matter if Megan prefers that to the alternative, it&#8217;s still tacky.</p>


	<p>Second, the plants themselves are very nice.  I felt like <a href="http://www.greenleafgardens/">Kathy</a> really listened to us and knew what we wanted.  That really showed up in the final results.</p>


	<p>Third, I&#8217;ve never really had such visible evidence of &#8220;Wow, I watered it and now it&#8217;s really growing!&#8221;  It&#8217;s a bonding experience, espcecially for such a techie like myself. We have some really excellent rose bushes!  They are <a href="http://www.knockoutroses.com/">a new kind of rose</a>, apparently, and they&#8217;ve already taken off.</p>


	<p>Finally, the watering and weeding (at this point) is very centering for me.  Spending a few minutes thinking of nothing besides covering some beds with water is very Zen like.  I&#8217;ve even done some weeding over the past couple of days&#8212;it&#8217;s so frustrating to see some stupid onion shoots in the middle of all those beautiful plants!</p>
