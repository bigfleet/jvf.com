  <div class="entry-content"><p>Her landlord promised an &#8220;early moveout bonus&#8221; for being out by the 25th.  She did a lot of work to get packed up over this past weekend so that we&#8217;d have a chance at it.  We scheduled the movers to come last night, then found out that the &#8220;bonus&#8221; was <em>getting your deposit back earlier!</em>  This leads to Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #46: <strong>If you are offered a bonus for moving out early, find out what it is before you prepare to claim it.</strong>  Believe me, we&#8217;ll be having more of them as we go along, then I&#8217;ll get them all together.  I&#8217;ve learned a ton about buying houses.</p>


	<p>The experience with the moving company was interesting to say the least.  Fortunately, Megan&#8217;s mother was able to be there early, since the movers were also early.  I was just on time.  At any rate, they were the only ones that I found available on short notice.  They are a &#8220;christian company&#8221;, whatever that means.  Megan&#8217;s mom said that they prayed to begin moving, and I can verify that we prayed when she left, and we prayed when we were done moving.  This seems a bit odd to me, but Megan really thought it was funny.</p>


	<p>Anyway, it was overall not a good experience.  The home office&#8217;s conversations with Megan established a price ceiling which I, of course, knew nothing about.  The movers did a competent job, but started out expensive and became more so.  There&#8217;s two tips out of this one.</p>


	<p>Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #22: <strong>Schedule your move out more than one month in advance.</strong>  I recommend Two Men And a Truck.  They don&#8217;t seem to be a franchise, but I had fantastic moves with them in both Houston and Virginia, so that&#8217;s something.  I&#8217;m calling them today.</p>


	<p>Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #9: <strong>Pack your own boxes before using movers.</strong>  Unless you already have some degree of wealth, this will bring movers into your price range.</p>


	<p>So, I&#8217;m for moving her out of there ourselves with some friendly help.  Maybe I&#8217;ll be driving the fifteen-footer soon enough!  The Pontiac Catalina gave me good training.  Imagine a car that looks like <a href="http://www.hemmings.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/classifieds.cardetail/id/2200255">this</a>, but twice as big.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I had a good meeting with a local real estate investor group.  Real estate investment is something I heard about first from Rich Dad, Poor Dad which is a book I&#8217;ll have a review up for shortly.  At any rate, for various reasons including late-night infomercials, the real estate market is hot.  I&#8217;ve been following the scene for awhile, and there is absolutely no good software to support the mind-numbing amount of detail that active investors have to keep up with.  As writing software happens to be a talent of mine, I see this as an opportunity to learn the business and create a potentially hit product all at once.</p>


	<p>I filed as an <span class="caps">LLC</span> last week and should get my registration sometime this week.  I have purchased domain names.  In another two weeks or so, I should have a usable product that&#8217;s small in scope.  &#8220;It&#8217;ll be better, not beta&#8221; is the rallying cry of <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">37 Signals</a> and the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> folks, and one that I think is suitable.  (The Rails community is where I&#8217;m focusing my spare mental energy on the technical side these days.)</p>


	<p>So, that is pretty much my first play to make a bunch of money.  I&#8217;ll let you guys now how it&#8217;s going.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, the instructions are massively useful in completing this test.  Keep this in mind as we progress.</p>

<p>Second, this is just one possible walkthrough, and it&#8217;s the second time I have gone through the test.  It was <strong>much</strong> harder the first time.</p>

<h3>Easy Ones:</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s my sincerest wish that identity will hold in this exam;  the answer to #5 is <em>E</em>.</p>

<p>#20 gets special attention in the instructions, and by consulting reference material, we establish that answer is <em>E</em></p>

<h3>Warming Up:</h3>

<p>Questions #10 and #16 refer to each other.  The only correct set of answers possible means #10 is <em>A</em> and #16 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>Questions #6 and #17 refer to each other.  When one considers that the answer to #17 cannot be D because of question #2, the only correct set of answers; #6 is <em>D</em>, and #17 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>The instructions state that the solution to the quiz is unique.  I am not afraid to use shortcuts, so let&#8217;s do some analysis on #12.  Uniqueness would imply that neither C,D, nor E could be the answer, as that would necessitate A or B also being a possible answer.  Thus, not only can we eliminate C,D, and E as choices, we also establish that the number of consonants cannot be in the following:
<ul>
<li>1, 4, 9, 16 (perfect squares)</li>
<li>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 (primes)</li>
<li>10, 15, 20 (divisible by 5)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This means that the number of consonant answers can be either 6, 8, 12, 14, or 18.  These are all even numbers, so the answer to #12 is <em>A</em>.
</p>

<p>#15 directly references this answer, so #15 is also <em>A</em>.  #15 is now established as the only odd-numbered question with the answer of A, which means the answer to #13 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<div class="catchup" style="border: 1px solid black; float:right; padding: 2px; margin: 2px;">
<pre>
Catchup:

 1. ?   6. D  11. ?  16. D
 2. ?   7. ?  12. A  17. B
 3. ?   8. ?  13. D  18. ?
 4. ?   9. ?  14. ?  19. ?
 5. E  10. A  15. A  20. E

</pre>
</div>

<h3>Let Me See&#8230;</h3>

<p>#1 cannot possibly be A or B and remain internally consistent.  There are already two questions answered E so #1 cannot be C.  The answer to #5 is E, eliminating E as a possibility.  The answer to #1, therefore, is <em>D</em>.  This means the answer to #4 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>#4 states that there are 5 A&#8217;s, and we already have two E&#8217;s.  This means that the only possible answer to #8 is <em>E</em>.  There are eight vowels and twelve consonants.  The answer to #3 is <em>D</em>, as 8 vowels &#8211; 5 A&#8217;s = 3 E&#8217;s.  We have eight vowels and twelve consonants.</p>

<h3>My Head Is Starting To Hurt A Little:</h3>

<p>#9 is not A because of the answer to #13 indicates that #15 is the only odd-numbered question with the answer A.  It cannot be C because the answer to #12 is not C.  It cannot be E because we already have 3 E&#8217;s per #3.  Suppose the answer to #9 was B.  The answer to #11 would then necessarily be B&#8212;but that would be a contridiction, since the answers to #4 and #9 would be B.  Hence the answer to #9 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>The answer to #11 cannot be A since #4 is B.  Hence the answer to #2 must be A as the other answers have been established.  This means the answer to #7 is <em>D</em>.  We can now count to see that the answer to #11 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<div class="catchup" style="border: 1px solid black; float:right; padding: 2px; margin: 2px;">
<pre>
Catchup:

 1. D   6. D  11. B  16. D
 2. A   7. D  12. A  17. B
 3. D   8. E  13. D  18. ?
 4. B   9. D  14. ?  19. ?
 5. E  10. A  15. A  20. E

</pre>
</div>

<h3>Almost There:</h3>

<p>
Let&#8217;s do a little letter counting.

A: 4
B: 3
C: 0
D: 7
E: 3
</p>

<p>
#18 cannot possibly be B, C, or D because of the letter counts and number of questions left.  It cannot be E because of #3.  #18 must be <em>A</em>, satisfying the A requirement of 5.
</p>
<p>
#14 and #19 must therefore both be <em>B</em> to make 5 answers B.  We see that the count for letter D in question #14 is correct.
</p>
<p>
Give yourself a pat on the back for asking the indomitable #19!  Note also that the answer spells <span class="caps">DAD BEDDED A BAD BAD BABE</span>, which the author recognizes as a Fatal Attraction reference.  What a great test!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am going absolutely crazy reading blogs and adding to my <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks.  Here&#8217;s an example of one of the good things I&#8217;ve come across.  The conjecture is that <a title="Josh Kaufman: Inside My Bald Head: The Josh Kaufman "Personal MBA" Program (Updated 3/19/2005)" href="http://www.joshkaufman.net/archives/2005/03/the_josh_kaufma.html">you can get the equivalent of an <span class="caps">MBA</span> education by reading books.</a></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s not as much value, obviously, but it&#8217;s a lot cheaper.  By the way, these are the books I&#8217;m devouring these days.</p>
