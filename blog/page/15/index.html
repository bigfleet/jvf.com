  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is contuining in my now-current tradition of posting about events several months later.</p>


	<p>The annual family vacation to Wilmington, NC this year was a lot of fun.  Not only did I <a href="lifes-true-joys">get engaged</a>, but we played tennis, got to the beach, watched some movies, ate some great food and played some cards.  I also got to visit Brady down in South Carolina.  We really enjoyed our trip down to South Carolina for her wedding a couple of weeks ago as well.</p>


	<p>The only troubling thought was the realization that even after living in Wilmington for about two years, when I come back in another two, the only thing I may know about the town is where most of the roads go.  Established restaurants, cornerstones of the town, are opening up sister restaurants, moving, or closing down.  Movie theaters are closing down.  They&#8217;re building new roads that circle the town, making everything more convenient, but I felt like a tool when I took us on a 45 minute drive that could have taken 15.</p>


	<p>I have never really cared if any town has changed, as long as I like the changes.  (Most of the changes in Wilmington are for the better.)  But in this case, I still wish those changes had never happened.  At some point, I&#8217;ll look back and any trace of the life Erin and I led will be gone.  Memory only helps so much.  It&#8217;s a process&#8212;I&#8217;m still getting used to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
	<li><a href="http://uvacows.livejournal.com/">Megan&#8217;s blogging</a> a lot more than I am now.  How embarrassing!  But I couldn&#8217;t be happier at the prospect, since we&#8217;re already talking about how differently we value and treat our memories.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>We&#8217;ve decided on a couple of wedding details.  We&#8217;re getting married at the Dominion Club here in Richmond.  Megan has already bought her dress, and my sister has already bought one of the bridesmaid dresses, since one of the colors has also been selected.  We&#8217;re working on getting the budget for the food put together, then a lot of other pieces will fall into place.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve fiddled around with the blog software that powers this blog, and, as much as I&#8217;d like to say otherwise, I&#8217;m likely to be on this software for the near future.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am very happy having moved my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/06/09/making-tracks">Tracks installation</a> to my friend <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/">Ryan&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.gtdtracks.com/">GTDTracks</a> service.  It&#8217;s very affordable, considering I was spending much more than its monthly cost trying to keep it running on my own machine at home.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>My <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/confluence">favorite Wiki</a> is available for free to non-profits.  I&#8217;ve chosen <a href="http://www.rose-hosting.com/">Rose Hosting</a> since they offered Debian Sarge at a reasonable monthly rate.  Hopefully, <span class="caps">CISV</span> will finally have a wiki that won&#8217;t scare people and that can keep out the thugs.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m hopeful that the <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/"><span class="caps">CISV USA</span></a> website redesign project will begin relatively soon.  We&#8217;re waiting on a design from International.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve announced that I&#8217;m in the most fun fantasy league I&#8217;ve ever been in.  I&#8217;m also doing quite alright.  My goal was to score 55 points (in a 10-team league, that&#8217;s moderately above average) and to finish &#8220;in the pack&#8221;.  I&#8217;m a little behind that, currently, but at one point I was in third place.  I&#8217;ve got a better team for the future than I thought I would have.  My off-season will now be visited by monsters.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I had a great time during a visit with <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/">Jeremy</a> last week.  I have been a bit concerned at various times during our past discussions that attempting to merge our outlooks would result in more heat than light, but now I&#8217;m more hopeful that we&#8217;ll both learn a lot from the process.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am, of course, salivating at the prospect of another football season.  Especially one where I&#8217;ll get to see my first <span class="caps">UVA</span> Cavaliers game.  I&#8217;ll be at the Thursday night game, Oct. 19, against the North Carolina Tar Heels.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Last night&#8217;s UT-Florida game is just another example of why I love college football.  Dramatic, huge momentum changes, great football played by young men on both sides, lots of mental toughness, and a bunch of great stories.  I loved it, even if UT did take the loss.</li>
	</ul>

<time datetime="2006-09-15T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 15<span>th</span>, 2006</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>While we were <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/09/17/stranger-in-a-familiar-land">on vacation</a>, our yard was magically transformed from one with builder&#8217;s grade holly bushes and juniper stumps to one with two full beds around the two main edges of the house, a new tree, and new beds under the existing tree and by our mailbox.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s been exciting for many reasons.</p>


	<p>First, I finally feel like the neighborhood has evidence that we care about how our house looks.  Those stumps have been out in the yard for about a year, and no matter if Megan prefers that to the alternative, it&#8217;s still tacky.</p>


	<p>Second, the plants themselves are very nice.  I felt like <a href="http://www.greenleafgardens/">Kathy</a> really listened to us and knew what we wanted.  That really showed up in the final results.</p>


	<p>Third, I&#8217;ve never really had such visible evidence of &#8220;Wow, I watered it and now it&#8217;s really growing!&#8221;  It&#8217;s a bonding experience, espcecially for such a techie like myself. We have some really excellent rose bushes!  They are <a href="http://www.knockoutroses.com/">a new kind of rose</a>, apparently, and they&#8217;ve already taken off.</p>


	<p>Finally, the watering and weeding (at this point) is very centering for me.  Spending a few minutes thinking of nothing besides covering some beds with water is very Zen like.  I&#8217;ve even done some weeding over the past couple of days&#8212;it&#8217;s so frustrating to see some stupid onion shoots in the middle of all those beautiful plants!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unfortunately for all of us Virginia residents, our Department of Motor Vehicles is bereft of love.</p>


	<h2>The Setup</h2>


	<p>Today&#8217;s goal was to transfer the title of the car I&#8217;ve been driving for many years into my name.  My parents were the previous owners, and they own the car outright.</p>


	<p>They signed the title over to me quite some time ago.  The task of transferring the title, getting new tags, and getting new insurance fell to me.</p>


	<p>Upon my visit today, I was told that I needed to add the number of miles on the odometer to the title before the transfer.  I went out to the car and did that, but wrote down the number incorrectly.  Thinking that an accurate number was most important, I changed the &#8220;2&#8221; to a &#8220;1&#8221;.</p>


	<p>I was then denyed the ability to transfer the title based on this act.  Even though the owners of the car had expressed their intent to sell the car to me, and I had indicated my intention to buy the car, the state would not allow the transaction to take place.</p>


	<p>After pointing out that his insistence upon a correct number would only carry what one might call societal weight based on the purchaser&#8217;s (read: my) right to a fair bill of goods, and that I would be happy to waive that right and stipulate that the higher mileage figure was accurate.  I was told the central office in the city of Richmond audits the odometer section for cross-outs, erasures, etc. and in case of an error of this nature is processed, the particular branch where I was making the request is penalized.</p>


	<p>After pointing out that the number is not in error, and that my &#8220;service&#8221; representative could verify the mileage on the car easily right now, he said that fact was immaterial, as the car will not be available when the audit is being performed.</p>


	<p>As a result, I will be unable to transfer the title until I send the title back to my parents for reverification.  The title will have to go through the mail twice, and I will have to wait at the <span class="caps">DMV</span> again.</p>


	<p>I am already one week past my registration deadline, although that, of course, is no fault of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles but rather, tragically, my own ignorance.</p>


	<h2>The Sting</h2>


	<p>As <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003270.html">this post&#8217;s namesake</a> indicates, a story without love is not worth telling.  So even though the aggravation is not yet over, you will see that there is reason and benevolence yet still.</p>


	<p>I was stopped by a policeman while driving to work after this <span class="caps">DMV</span> debacle because my registration and plates had expired.  Obviously, my next step was to give him a very abbreviated version of the story I have just shared with you here.</p>


	<p>He gave me a warning for everything I still needed to do with the car.  If I am stopped again, I will receive those tickets, which come to about $1,000 if I were to actually end up paying them.  By listening to reason and giving me a chance, he ensured that the State of Virginia will get taxes on at least one additional week&#8217;s rental of an automobile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Calling people is taking absolutely <strong>forever</strong>, so for those who haven&#8217;t heard yet. Megan and I got engaged.  It&#8217;s getting to be so long since it happened that you&#8217;ll think I don&#8217;t care about you.</p>


	<p>It was on the first day of our beach vacation.  I hadn&#8217;t been planning it, but we were walking along the beach, and some other folks were setting off fireworks.  I had been thinking for ages about all the things I wanted to do, like make sure that she&#8217;d love the location, and getting the perfect jewelry item.  I realized, though, that none of that mattered at all, really, and I should just ask her.  She said <strong>yes!</strong></p>


	<p>We haven&#8217;t set a date yet, although it&#8217;ll probably be fall of next year.  We&#8217;ve really just begun looking at locations, although Megan has apparently bought her dress already.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3> One book that changed your life.</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to cheat straight away by giving two answers here.  First is <a href="amazon:0452011876">Atlas Shrugged</a> by Ayn Rand.  It wasn&#8217;t necessarily the book that brought about the change in my life as much as the accompanying discussion with an assistant professor of mine.  Regardless of what you might read of Rand, give the first few hundred pages of this book a try.</p>


	<p>Second is <a href="amazon:0446677450">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a> by Robert Kiyosaki.  I first heard of him at all by seeing <a href="amazon:B0002R5IKI">Cashflow</a> on Jennifer Brady&#8217;s living room table.  That notion kicked around in my head for awhile until I finally picked up the book, and it was a real kick in the seat of the pants.  The book itself is not really all that great, but it does ask some extremely important questions.  I found myself in a position where the largest check I had ever written was for approximately $3,000 (to the federal government, naturally) and I was getting ready to take on appreciably more than $100k in debt.  At that point, you have to ask yourself if you really have any idea what you&#8217;re doing.</p>


	<p>Reading this book made me realize that I really had never focused on the actual story of money in the world today.  Sure, I&#8217;d taken economics, finance, accounting, etc., but, believe me, that doesn&#8217;t tell the story of money and where it truly comes from.  This book doesn&#8217;t deal directly with that question, but Mr. Kiyosaki got me to ask it.  So there you go.</p>


	<h3>One book that you have read more than once.</h3>


	<p>I almost never do this.  There are so many new books to read!  The last time I remember doing this was after watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0109444/">Clear And Present Danger</a> and wanting to verify that, in fact, the movie was completely different from the book.  Not only did that prove to be true, but I enjoyed <a href="amazon:0425122123">the book</a> quite a bit more the second go-around.</p>


	<h3>One book that you would want on a desert island.</h3>


	<p>Although <a href="amazon:0060734345">this answer</a> is a popular, smart-ass sort of response, I mean it in a truly sincere way.  I have no clue about how to survive on a desert island, and I would prefer to fight it out a bit rather than just give up immediately.</p>


	<h3>One book that made you laugh.</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve never read a book even close to as funny as <a href="amazon:0316921173">Infinite Jest</a> besides maybe some Dave Barry books.</p>


	<h3>One book that made you cry.</h3>


	<p><a href="amazon:0071471723">Chasing Daylight</a>, which, if there&#8217;s any justice, I&#8217;ll write an entire post about some day.  Briefly, it concerns death.  Especially if you&#8217;ve never faced death in a real way in your own life, you must buy this book immediately.  Don&#8217;t bother with the rest of this article.</p>


	<h3>One book you wish had been written.</h3>


	<p>I hate complaining about questions you get &#8216;in bulk&#8217;, but it sounds to me as if this refers to a book that has not, in fact, been written.  If that is the case, then I would love to have a sequel to Secrets Of The Temple (more in a moment) that dealt with the Alan Greenspan years.</p>


	<p>If the question is actually &#8220;Name a book that you are thankful was written,&#8221; then my answer is <a href="amazon:0060740450">100 Years Of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</p>


	<h3>One book you wish had never been written.</h3>


	<p><a href="amazon:1400050324">Material</a> <a href="amazon:0440508649">that</a> <a href="amazon:0060514558">makes</a> <a href="amazon:0060392452">political</a>   <a href="amazon:0767920929">discussion</a> <a href="amazon:1560258810">into</a> <a href="amazon:0060734337">a</a> <a href="amazon:0679769781">mockery</a></p>


	<h3>One book you are currently reading.</h3>


	<p>Embarrisingly, <a href="amazon:0671675567">Secrets of the Temple</a> about the Federal Reserve.  I&#8217;ve left it at a restaurant, taken a pause to watch an entire anime series, finished <a href="amazon:0195189779">another book</a> in the meantime, etc.  It&#8217;s been one of my favorite books I&#8217;ve ever read, and almost certainly the most important.  It&#8217;s just long, and in a bit of a dull spot.</p>


	<h3>One book you have been meaning to read.</h3>


	<p>My list of books I&#8217;d like to read is so lengthy, I don&#8217;t know how to pick just one.  I am probably going to read <a href="amazon:0679764410">American Sphinx</a> after I read the <a href="amazon:1411693957">book Jeremy loaned me</a></p>


	<h3>Now tag five people</h3>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://uvacows.livejournal.com/">Megan Epp</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://toxicpuce.livejournal.com/">Racer X</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>I can&#8217;t tag anyone else because they wouldn&#8217;t possibly respond.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> The links are all broken until I figure out a good way to rewrite them.  Curse you, typo lockin!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I upgraded the software that runs this blog in an effort to keep pages other than the main page up for a few hours at a time.  For those of you who may have visited recently and caught the very minimal look, that was because the stylesheets weren&#8217;t working.</p>


	<p>Commenting doesn&#8217;t work with my old theme, so it&#8217;s back to the default look for now.  I&#8217;ll try to find something soon, I don&#8217;t particularly care for this.</p>

	<li>The <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/06/now_whos_a_bigg.html">Jerk/Genius</a> ratio for the Van Fleet family is astronomical, at just under 13 (11,400 to about 900).  The ratio for myself personally is closer to 3 (23/7), but none of them are referring to anyone named Jim Van Fleet actually being a jerk.</li>
