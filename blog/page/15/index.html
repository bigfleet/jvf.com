  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unfortunately for all of us Virginia residents, our Department of Motor Vehicles is bereft of love.</p>


	<h2>The Setup</h2>


	<p>Today&#8217;s goal was to transfer the title of the car I&#8217;ve been driving for many years into my name.  My parents were the previous owners, and they own the car outright.</p>


	<p>They signed the title over to me quite some time ago.  The task of transferring the title, getting new tags, and getting new insurance fell to me.</p>


	<p>Upon my visit today, I was told that I needed to add the number of miles on the odometer to the title before the transfer.  I went out to the car and did that, but wrote down the number incorrectly.  Thinking that an accurate number was most important, I changed the &#8220;2&#8221; to a &#8220;1&#8221;.</p>


	<p>I was then denyed the ability to transfer the title based on this act.  Even though the owners of the car had expressed their intent to sell the car to me, and I had indicated my intention to buy the car, the state would not allow the transaction to take place.</p>


	<p>After pointing out that his insistence upon a correct number would only carry what one might call societal weight based on the purchaser&#8217;s (read: my) right to a fair bill of goods, and that I would be happy to waive that right and stipulate that the higher mileage figure was accurate.  I was told the central office in the city of Richmond audits the odometer section for cross-outs, erasures, etc. and in case of an error of this nature is processed, the particular branch where I was making the request is penalized.</p>


	<p>After pointing out that the number is not in error, and that my &#8220;service&#8221; representative could verify the mileage on the car easily right now, he said that fact was immaterial, as the car will not be available when the audit is being performed.</p>


	<p>As a result, I will be unable to transfer the title until I send the title back to my parents for reverification.  The title will have to go through the mail twice, and I will have to wait at the <span class="caps">DMV</span> again.</p>


	<p>I am already one week past my registration deadline, although that, of course, is no fault of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles but rather, tragically, my own ignorance.</p>


	<h2>The Sting</h2>


	<p>As <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003270.html">this post&#8217;s namesake</a> indicates, a story without love is not worth telling.  So even though the aggravation is not yet over, you will see that there is reason and benevolence yet still.</p>


	<p>I was stopped by a policeman while driving to work after this <span class="caps">DMV</span> debacle because my registration and plates had expired.  Obviously, my next step was to give him a very abbreviated version of the story I have just shared with you here.</p>


	<p>He gave me a warning for everything I still needed to do with the car.  If I am stopped again, I will receive those tickets, which come to about $1,000 if I were to actually end up paying them.  By listening to reason and giving me a chance, he ensured that the State of Virginia will get taxes on at least one additional week&#8217;s rental of an automobile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Calling people is taking absolutely <strong>forever</strong>, so for those who haven&#8217;t heard yet. Megan and I got engaged.  It&#8217;s getting to be so long since it happened that you&#8217;ll think I don&#8217;t care about you.</p>


	<p>It was on the first day of our beach vacation.  I hadn&#8217;t been planning it, but we were walking along the beach, and some other folks were setting off fireworks.  I had been thinking for ages about all the things I wanted to do, like make sure that she&#8217;d love the location, and getting the perfect jewelry item.  I realized, though, that none of that mattered at all, really, and I should just ask her.  She said <strong>yes!</strong></p>


	<p>We haven&#8217;t set a date yet, although it&#8217;ll probably be fall of next year.  We&#8217;ve really just begun looking at locations, although Megan has apparently bought her dress already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3> One book that changed your life.</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to cheat straight away by giving two answers here.  First is <a href="amazon:0452011876">Atlas Shrugged</a> by Ayn Rand.  It wasn&#8217;t necessarily the book that brought about the change in my life as much as the accompanying discussion with an assistant professor of mine.  Regardless of what you might read of Rand, give the first few hundred pages of this book a try.</p>


	<p>Second is <a href="amazon:0446677450">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a> by Robert Kiyosaki.  I first heard of him at all by seeing <a href="amazon:B0002R5IKI">Cashflow</a> on Jennifer Brady&#8217;s living room table.  That notion kicked around in my head for awhile until I finally picked up the book, and it was a real kick in the seat of the pants.  The book itself is not really all that great, but it does ask some extremely important questions.  I found myself in a position where the largest check I had ever written was for approximately $3,000 (to the federal government, naturally) and I was getting ready to take on appreciably more than $100k in debt.  At that point, you have to ask yourself if you really have any idea what you&#8217;re doing.</p>


	<p>Reading this book made me realize that I really had never focused on the actual story of money in the world today.  Sure, I&#8217;d taken economics, finance, accounting, etc., but, believe me, that doesn&#8217;t tell the story of money and where it truly comes from.  This book doesn&#8217;t deal directly with that question, but Mr. Kiyosaki got me to ask it.  So there you go.</p>


	<h3>One book that you have read more than once.</h3>


	<p>I almost never do this.  There are so many new books to read!  The last time I remember doing this was after watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0109444/">Clear And Present Danger</a> and wanting to verify that, in fact, the movie was completely different from the book.  Not only did that prove to be true, but I enjoyed <a href="amazon:0425122123">the book</a> quite a bit more the second go-around.</p>


	<h3>One book that you would want on a desert island.</h3>


	<p>Although <a href="amazon:0060734345">this answer</a> is a popular, smart-ass sort of response, I mean it in a truly sincere way.  I have no clue about how to survive on a desert island, and I would prefer to fight it out a bit rather than just give up immediately.</p>


	<h3>One book that made you laugh.</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve never read a book even close to as funny as <a href="amazon:0316921173">Infinite Jest</a> besides maybe some Dave Barry books.</p>


	<h3>One book that made you cry.</h3>


	<p><a href="amazon:0071471723">Chasing Daylight</a>, which, if there&#8217;s any justice, I&#8217;ll write an entire post about some day.  Briefly, it concerns death.  Especially if you&#8217;ve never faced death in a real way in your own life, you must buy this book immediately.  Don&#8217;t bother with the rest of this article.</p>


	<h3>One book you wish had been written.</h3>


	<p>I hate complaining about questions you get &#8216;in bulk&#8217;, but it sounds to me as if this refers to a book that has not, in fact, been written.  If that is the case, then I would love to have a sequel to Secrets Of The Temple (more in a moment) that dealt with the Alan Greenspan years.</p>


	<p>If the question is actually &#8220;Name a book that you are thankful was written,&#8221; then my answer is <a href="amazon:0060740450">100 Years Of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</p>


	<h3>One book you wish had never been written.</h3>


	<p><a href="amazon:1400050324">Material</a> <a href="amazon:0440508649">that</a> <a href="amazon:0060514558">makes</a> <a href="amazon:0060392452">political</a>   <a href="amazon:0767920929">discussion</a> <a href="amazon:1560258810">into</a> <a href="amazon:0060734337">a</a> <a href="amazon:0679769781">mockery</a></p>


	<h3>One book you are currently reading.</h3>


	<p>Embarrisingly, <a href="amazon:0671675567">Secrets of the Temple</a> about the Federal Reserve.  I&#8217;ve left it at a restaurant, taken a pause to watch an entire anime series, finished <a href="amazon:0195189779">another book</a> in the meantime, etc.  It&#8217;s been one of my favorite books I&#8217;ve ever read, and almost certainly the most important.  It&#8217;s just long, and in a bit of a dull spot.</p>


	<h3>One book you have been meaning to read.</h3>


	<p>My list of books I&#8217;d like to read is so lengthy, I don&#8217;t know how to pick just one.  I am probably going to read <a href="amazon:0679764410">American Sphinx</a> after I read the <a href="amazon:1411693957">book Jeremy loaned me</a></p>


	<h3>Now tag five people</h3>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://uvacows.livejournal.com/">Megan Epp</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://toxicpuce.livejournal.com/">Racer X</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>I can&#8217;t tag anyone else because they wouldn&#8217;t possibly respond.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> The links are all broken until I figure out a good way to rewrite them.  Curse you, typo lockin!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Roadblocks</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get some version of Linux installed in one way or another on one of my machines for a very long time.  A good portion of the work I do is still very unfriendly towards Windows.  It never worked because I could never get an install working with all my commodity hardware working.  I may be a geek, but recompiling a kernel is not something I&#8217;m eager to learn how to do.  If I can&#8217;t figure out how to work around the problem in 15 minutes with Google, forget it.</p>


	<p>With Ubuntu, this problem is solved in the extreme.  When I was last decontaminating my parent&#8217;s computer from its spyware infestation, I had to rebuild the machine from scratch.  Seeing my opportunity to move one step closer to not having to support Windows any longer, I took the opportunity to install Ubuntu Breezy (the latest version at the time).  The install was over, with everything working, in about 30 minutes.  I even had the printer installed and working as well as the e-mail client set up.</p>


	<p>With Windows, it took <span class="caps">HOURS</span>.  And I was lucky that I knew to save everything in the <em>C:\DELL</em> folder very carefully or I&#8217;d be spending even more time downloading drivers.  I was blown away by the fact that on commodity hardware, Linux was an easier install for me than Windows was.</p>


	<h3>The Beautiful Part</h3>


	<p>Ubuntu Dapper is free.  It&#8217;s free as in &#8220;free beer.&#8221;  You can go to the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu website</a> and request that they ship you a CD.  It&#8217;s free as in &#8220;free speech&#8221;.  If I were so inclined, I could download the source code and figure out how to change anything I might want to change.  Fix typos, etc. in my case.  Other people can do more.  I&#8217;d then have to speak to a friendly developer to get it actually incorporated into <strong>everyone&#8217;s</strong> copy, but that is the idea.  Anyone can contribute.  That&#8217;s a powerful idea.</p>


	<h3>My Own Dapper Install</h3>


	<h4>Web Applications</h4>


	<p>That&#8217;s what I do, and getting them set up on Dapper wasn&#8217;t a problem in the slightest.  Sun has allowed Linux developers to package the Sun version of Java with Linux, which is like upgrading from a Pinto to a Cadillac.</p>


	<p>I also run a version of Atlassian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a> product, since they are currently giving away personal licenses free.  That means I can use Confluence, the finest Wiki I&#8217;ve encountered, as my personal scrapbook.  I like that.</p>


	<p>I already mentioned that I am <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/06/09/making-tracks">using Tracks</a>.  That was dependent on my Ruby and Rails setup, which I&#8217;ll be detailing soon.  I&#8217;m hoping that post will be good enough to make the rounds a little bit.</p>


	<h4>Installing Apps</h4>


	<p>The package management system has been my second major stumbling block in terms of Linux adoption.  Debian makes this a no-brainer.  The apt-get system is simply brilliant.</p>


	<h3> Not So Fast</h3>


	<p>I am not anywhere close to leaving Windows entirely behind.  Some web applications still require Internet Explorer to function.  There&#8217;s still no real equivalent to Microsoft Money that I&#8217;ve found.  TiVo Desktop is still a Windows application.  Fortunately, I have an older machine that can handle XP and I just <span class="caps">RDP</span> into it when I need to.  A small price to pay!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over Memorial Day, Megan and I visited Long Island for her brother&#8217;s wedding.  Both the rehearsal dinner and the ceremony were very beautiful.  The bride, groom, and Megan were all looking particularly lovely as well.  Even I managed not to look repulsive.  I did have a lot of fun at both events and am glad I was able to go.</p>


	<p>I thought it was pretty funny to see that Long Island apparently considers the rest of New York state a bit like Texas views the rest of the country.  Sure, there&#8217;s a formal relationship, but they are pretty much doing their own thing.</p>


	<p>I managed to get a little rest over the weekend, but not much.  Relationship winds were somewhat blustery among the bride and groom&#8217;s families, but nothing too serious.  Still I feel I was very fortunate to be in attendance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The idea behind <a href="http://www.lala.com/">lala.com</a> is that of being the Internet&#8217;s used CD store.  Pick up albums you think you might like on the cheap, bring them back in if you don&#8217;t like them, trade them for something else.  To acquire a used CD (without liner notes or jewel case) is $1.49.  &#8220;Not a bad price!&#8221;  But you have to trade in your CD&#8217;s to get any out at all.</p>


	<p>My first thought on using the system was &#8220;I just input 150 of my CD&#8217;s, and I would trade two of these in, and <strong>might</strong> trade another two.&#8221;  What&#8217;s the big deal?</p>


	<p>But then, two things happened.  I got an impeccible copy of Alpha&#8217;s <em>The Impossible Thrill</em>, featuring liner notes and the artwork for the back of the jewel case.  Wow.</p>


	<p>I then spent a little more time exploring the site, and got my want list up to about 80 albums.  I am now rabidly looking through my list, thinking &#8220;I could go without that CD.  I <strong>want my orders filled!</strong>&#8221;  They&#8217;ve got me.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what lala&#8217;s all about, drop me a line.  I&#8217;ll be happy to send you an invite.</p>
