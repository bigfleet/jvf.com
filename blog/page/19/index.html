  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know, only like two of you care about all this geekery.</p>


	<p>In general, my life is going well.  Megan and I are having a lot of fun, as always.  We&#8217;re gearing up to send invitations out for our holiday party on the 30th.  (Save the date, if you&#8217;re reading&#8230;)</p>


	<p>My job at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERThought</a> has been a challenge, but not in the ways that I expected.  I do feel, thought, that I am beginning to settle there.  I enjoy the people I work with there more than I have since college, so that&#8217;s a big plus.  The job itself still has a lot of unexpected facets, so as I&#8217;m more fully settled, you&#8217;ll hear more from me here.</p>


	<p>With the way I&#8217;ve been feeling, that&#8217;s been enough to pretty much fill my day.  I got my mom a flat-panel monitor for Christmas and her birthday.  She badly needed it for desk control.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting my dad something a little different.  I want to get him blogging since he has a lot of great ideas he&#8217;d love to share, and he&#8217;s looking for a job.  My Mom and Dad have always been very with it, and I want to help bring him up to the cutting edge of the job search sphere.</p>


	<p>(Mom set up her own <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and <span class="caps">SMTP</span> client once.  Beat <strong>that</strong>, other moms!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Before We Begin</h2>


	<p>The point of this lesson is to get you on your feet in an X environment; the basis of any workstation.  You&#8217;ll get an introduction to the ports system and see what it&#8217;s like to use it.  I include a couple of tips for ordering your port installation and a few examples of ports that I&#8217;ve installed at the end.</p>


	<h2> Ports, Explained</h2>


	<p>In the <a href="http//blah/">last lesson</a>, we covered installing the ports system using <span class="caps">CVSUP</span>.  Ports is the package management system for FreeBSD.  It&#8217;s highly dependent on source code compilation, so it&#8217;s not for the impatient.  However, the ports system has high standard for a &#8220;non-broken&#8221; port, and the maintainers of any given port are given continuous feedback for circumstances that &#8220;break&#8221; the port.  As a result, you can use ports without being that comfortable with many of the major compilation issues and strategies;  odds are that it will <em>just work</em>.</p>


	<h2> Using the ports system.</h2>


	<p>The first step I took with my newly installed system was to log in as root and&#8230;</p>


<code>
<pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-servers/xorg-server/
# make install clean
</pre>
</code>

	<p>That&#8217;s it.  Let that run, and eventually you will have an X server running.  The ports system itself will walk the necessary dependency chains, installing other ports as needed.</p>


	<h2> Interlude: configuration and <code>rehash</code></h2>


	<p>After the above command has completed, issue the <code>rehash</code> command.  Essentially, this tells FreeBSD to go back and re-evaluate your <span class="caps">PATH</span>, giving you access to any newly installed programs.  In this case, you&#8217;ve picked up <code>xorgconfig</code>, which you should now run.</p>


	<h2> Getting a bit tricky</h2>


Ports evaluate dependency chains as best it can, but it&#8217;s not a perfect system.  For example, if we were to&#8230;
<code><pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/gnome2
</pre></code>
we could <code>make install clean</code> immediately, but let&#8217;s say we were going to sleep after issuing that command.  During the middle of the night, this command would end up blocking on configuration choices for the <code>ghostscript</code> port.

	<p>So you don&#8217;t wake up to yummy Gnome!  The answer, in this case, is to install the <code>print/ghostscript-gpl</code> port first (which doesn&#8217;t take very long) then start gnome.</p>


	<p>(KDE, by the way, blocks on at least a half-dozen dependencies. <code>artswrapper, postgres-client (?!?), openslp, kdegraphics, kdemultimedia, kdepim, and boost-python</code>)</p>


	<p>There are ways to have these preferences taken into account without having them come up directly in the <code>make</code> process, but I&#8217;m still experimenting with the alternatives and trying to figure out how some of the tricky stuff works.  I&#8217;ll be happy to leave an update when I crack the case.</p>


	<h2>Recommended Ports</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Firefox (www/firefox)</li>
		<li>OpenOffice.Org v.2 (editors/openoffice-2.0)
 Gnome (x11-wm/gnome2)
(although gnome2-lite looks interesting&#8230;)</li>
		<li>lighttpd (www/lighttpd)</li>
		<li>Ruby (devel/ruby18)</li>
		<li>Subversion (devel/subversion)</li>
		<li>tsclient (net/tsclient) This program handles <span class="caps">RDP</span> connections to Windows machines and <span class="caps">VNC</span> connections to others.  Beats both gdesktop and kdesktop.</li>
		<li>Trac (www/trac)</li>
		<li>Gimp (graphics/gimp)</li>
		<li>Gaim (net-im/gaim)</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>


	<p>The Java ports.  FreeBSD&#8217;s support for Java might seem intimidating, but it&#8217;s not so bad, as long as you can live with 1.4.  You can still run Eclipse, and a lot of Java programs on the 1.4 <span class="caps">JDK</span>.</p>

<time datetime="2005-12-12T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 12<span>th</span>, 2005</time> - 
        


        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Before We Get Started</h3>


	<p>First, the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">documentation for FreeBSD</a> is absolutely fabulous.  If you are Googling something about FreeBSD, your heart will sing when one of the links is from the handbook, because the answer will soon be in your grasp.</p>


	<p>Second, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/ct/15">Dru Lavigne&#8217;s FreeBSD series</a> is another fantastic resources.  I highly recommend reading those articles, as they&#8217;ve been very informative during my adoption process.</p>


	<p>Third, I decided to track FreeBSD-STABLE based on the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html">criteria for choosing between <span class="caps">STABLE</span> and <span class="caps">CURRENT</span></a>.  You don&#8217;t have to do either&#8212;you can simply install from binaries.  But this is a learning exercize for me, and I think it would be a great learning experience to be able to contribute to FreeBSD somehow.  That&#8217;s much more likely from <span class="caps">STABLE</span> at least.</p>


	<h3>Step 1: Obtaining the Install CDs</h3>


	<p>FreeBSD 6.0 is the latest release of FreeBSD.  Download both <span class="caps">ISO</span> files, as you&#8217;ll need at least one port off the second CD.  FreeBSD offers <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/6.0R/announce.html">several methods</a> for acquiring the CD&#8217;s or <span class="caps">ISO</span> images.  Assuming that you <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/11/15/getting-started">have space on your hard drive available</a> you can stick the CD in your drive and get going.</p>


	<h3>Step 2:  Beginning the Installation</h3>


	<p>Don&#8217;t blink an eye during the boot process.  Note that the <strong><span class="caps">F12</span></strong> key is the one to go for during the now lightning-fast <span class="caps">BIOS</span>/POST process on Dell machines.  It will give the the option to boot once from the CD, or to go to the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> menu to permanently move the CD option above the HD for booting purposes.</p>


	<p>When the FreeBSD installer loads, don&#8217;t blink here either.  It&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;ll need to choose <strong>option 7</strong> to boot with <span class="caps">USB</span> keyboard support.  From there, you should get into the installation itself.</p>


	<h3>Step 3:  Preparing a minimal install.</h3>


	<p>Go through the installation procedure.  You won&#8217;t need a walkthrough for every step, but here are some tips.  If you are going to want any Java elements on your system, enable Linux binary compatability when asked.  I recommend not configuring inetd, but enabling ssh.  Don&#8217;t look to me for advice on your bootloader, but FreeBSD&#8217;s is the bare minimum and don&#8217;t count on its flexibility.</p>


	<p>When installing, you only want to choose one port: <strong>cvsup-without-gui</strong>  One of the strengths of FreeBSD is the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html">ports collection</a> which is the FreeBSD analog to package administration, if you&#8217;re familiar with Linux system administration.  The ports system works in a fundamentally different way than package management, however.  We&#8217;ll cover that here in time, but Dru&#8217;s resources contain quite a bit of information about the ports system to get you started.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ll be using <span class="caps">CVSUP</span> to track FreeBSD&#8217;s <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository for ports and kernel code, as well.  Since we&#8217;ll be getting these crucial elements shortly, and they are easy to retrieve form the command line (provided you have a very basic grasp of vi&#8212;which I personally loathe), so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going with a minimum install.</p>


	<h3>Step 4: <span class="caps">CVSUP</span></h3>


	<p><span class="caps">CVSUP</span> is a special <span class="caps">CVS</span> bound to the FreeBSD source repositories.  I set up the binding for my machine by copying <code>/usr/share/examples/cvsup/stable-supfile</code> to <code>/root/supfile</code>.  I used vi to assign a hostname and to indicate that in addition to <code>src-all</code> (which downloads the kernel source) I would also like <code>ports-all tag=.</code>.  (Ports are tagged differently than kernel source&#8212;you can read more in the comments.)</p>


	<p>After that, <code>cvsup -L 2 /root/supfile</code> kicks off the download process.  When that&#8217;s complete, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to configure a kernel, and/or get started installing any number of programs.  Hooray!</p>


	<h3>What&#8217;s Next:</h3>


	<p>I choose to set up some userland programs so I can start using my machine again after a long downtime period.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An incident with Megan last night and a link this morning reminded me about how hard it can be for a <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3566071">regular person to be fooled by phishing attacks</a></p>


	<p>Phishing is the practice of a spammer pretending that they are from a legitimate company, such as Bank Of America, Capital One, or PayPal.  The spammer will then include a link in an <span class="caps">HTML</span> e-mail claiming &#8220;Someone else is using your account!&#8221; or &#8220;Claim your free prize!&#8221; or something of that nature.  The link in the e-mail will be to some other domain, that has nothing to do with the legitimate company.  Then, when you enter your username and password, that third party has all the information they need to begin taking over your account.</p>


	<p>Megan received a particularly conniving one last night where the phishers used a domain that began with paypal.com.  It only matters what the domain <strong>ends</strong> with, not what the domain begins with.</p>


	<p>Whenever you get an e-mail like this, it&#8217;s best to bring up the regular homepage for <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com">Bank Of America</a>, <a href="http://www.capitalone.com/">Capital One</a> or <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> and login via the mechanism to which you are accustomed.</p>


	<p>Just trying to do my part, today.  Take care of yourselves out there.</p>

You can now subscribe to this blog via e-mail, meaning that you&#8217;ll receive a notification every time I post a new entry.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d prefer that you went the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/pages/about-rss"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> route, but I understand if you don&#8217;t want to complicate things.  Anyway, you now have the option.  If you try it, comment here to let me know how it works.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on retooling my sister&#8217;s old laptop so that Dad can use it, I also managed to update <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=wlem-si-html_viewall/002-3960055-6651260?id=1SOWWGWI7I8X3">my Amazon wishlist</a> so that interested parties would know exactly what I was after.  I had to delete quite a few things since I had actually already purchased them.  Good times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We hosted Thanksgiving yesterday for the families.  Megan&#8217;s folks came down early, since Megan&#8217;s mom had volunteered for the cooking.  My sister and parents came later, bringing a cheese plate and the wine.</p>


	<p>It was a great meal, and I had a great time.  Everybody seemed comfortable and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company.  That was a great feeling.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thankful for all the gifts that God has given me, and I continue to hope that I am worthy of them.</p>


	<p>Also, thanks everybody for reading my blog.  You should never hesitate to leave comments about anything.</p>
