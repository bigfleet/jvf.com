  <div class="entry-content"><p>As we speak, the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> project is preparing release candidates for version 8, featuring a <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pginstaller">native Windows installer</a>.  I&#8217;ve just used it successfully, and it beats the daylights out of the process for cygwin described below.</p>


	<p>For *nix users, this is not a big deal, but it&#8217;s not difficult to imagine that this development will go a long way towards more exposure for postgreSQL.  A feature by feature comparison with mySQL is pretty embarrasing for the latter, but now it appears that postgres is making big strides in getting into developer toolkits.  Sometimes clients just don&#8217;t want to mess around with a database that doesn&#8217;t deliver value immediately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
<li><p>Megan and I are still having a lot of fun together.  I met another one of her good friends, named Marta, who goes to school about a block away from Allie.  Not only did the three of us have fun, we went to an absolutely fantastic party hosted by another friend of Megan&#8217;s named Chris.  He&#8217;s a very sweet, gay, black man.  His friends say that he&#8217;s really blossomed since he&#8217;s been in Richmond, and that&#8217;s easy to believe!  He was the most gracious host, and his place was gorgeous.  I mixed a few drinks for myself and my friends, and talked to a bunch of fun, new people.  It&#8217;s been so long since I did something like that.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to go see The Magnetic Fields earlier this month.  It was a really great show.  I was expecting to hear all of <i>i</i>, their new record.  As it turned out, they played a few of the good songs off that record, a lot of <i>69 Love Songs</i>, my favorite record of theirs, and my single favorite track off one of their old records.  The sound quality was <strong>incredible</strong>, probably the best of any show I&#8217;ve ever been to.  I also saw Sufjan Stevens, which was also good.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally got the <span class="caps">OPGI</span> laptop sent back.  Of course, Chuck threatened to sue me for whatever reasons he had.  Thank goodness it&#8217;s over, that&#8217;s all I can say about that.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Getting postgreSQL up and running under Cygwin was not that difficult for me, although it does require a couple of Google searches.</p>

<p>First, the basic information is supplied <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs/text/FAQ_CYGWIN">here</a> by the folks at postgreSQL.</p>

<p>When I followed these instructions, however, I kept getting a failure message.  I should have copied it down, but since I didn&#8217;t expect the next step to work, I didn&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ll edit this soon to include the error message.</p>

<p>The second step came from a Rick Hightower blog post.  Simply use</p>
<pre>
&gt; export CYGWIN=server
</pre>
<p> before you issue any of the commands listed in step 1 and you should be golden.</p>

<li>I still don&#8217;t have a job.  Amentra balked at my request not to travel.  Would have been nice to have that job.

<li>I&#8217;m preparing to pass a Java Certified Programmer exam.  I did pass the mock exam I took, but I want to study some of the topics a bit more before I take the actual test.  Hopefully it&#8217;ll help me find this job.

<li>Things are looking better for me getting down to East Tennessee at the first part of the year.  That&#8217;d be a good trip.  I&#8217;d like to see Ashley and Jay and all my <i>um</i> dead friend&#8217;s relatives.  Meep.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A pretty huge topic, especially for a company to ask for on a job application.  Since I wrote it, here it is!</p>


	<p>In the engineering disciplines, constructs have physical characteristics; they are substantive.  As software engineers, we are not primarily concerned with the hardware in which our constructs live. We are concerned with the content of their lives.  Their relationships and their behavior are governed only by changes in polarity and currents of electricity.  As software engineers, we operate in a world of ideas.</p>


	<p>Our industry is young, and within such a boundless domain, possibilities for innovation are everywhere.  In the future, building trust-based communication channels with our business partners to facilitate collaboration on problem definitions and solutions will be just as important as any technical achievement.  As the libraries and languages available for our use change, we must constantly ask ourselves whether we are using the correct set of tools to solve any particular problem. Finally, we must innovate in our own work, providing solutions suitable not only for the circumstances we face today, but also for those we will face tomorrow.</p>


	<p>In my personal vision, investing time in open source products and languages is a key idea.  We face many challenges as developers, and leveraging a large base of highly talented developers across the globe makes fiscal and technical sense.  In addition, agile methodologies, such as Scrum, can help redefine the sometimes troubled relationship between the business and technical world.  Scrum encourages needed flexibility on both sides of a contract and facilitates honest communication about timelines and budgets, thus promoting the ultimate goals of the client.  It&#8217;s my belief that strong projects can be built using these ideas in the marketplace today and can continue to benefit developers, clients, and customers into the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, a buddy and I went to see our Tennessee Volunteers play Vanderbilt in basketball.  We knew that if we got there a little early, we could get tickets on the street really cheap.  My buddy went in one direction to get tickets and I started flagging people down from the lot where we had parked.  The first guy to pull up handed me $5 and asked me where to park.  I took the money and said, &#8220;Anywhere you like, sir.&#8221;  Then another car pulled up, and before I knew it, I had hauled in $150 when my buddy got back with some tickets.  He convinced me not to press my luck any further and we went to the game.  Afterward, we returned to our lot and there wasn&#8217;t a car to be found&#8212;we&#8217;d all been towed.  Somehow I managed to avoid everyone I had duped as we all paid&#8212;yep&#8212;$150 to get our cars back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The interview process with <a href="http://www.amentra.com">Amentra</a> has been going well.  The primary concern is the amount of travel possible.  I&#8217;m at a critical point here in my life in Richmond, and unless I get a chance to stay here and continue to go out with my girl and get comfortable in my environment, I&#8217;ll end up being miserable all over again.  Not worth a paycheck.</p>


	<p>Fortunately, that&#8217;s the only downside.  The job would be very challenging, but exciting.  It&#8217;s very much a small-team, us against the problem set up.  They rely on having very good people to get the job done.  I&#8217;m confident that I&#8217;d qualify.</p>


	<p>Bill&#8217;s older brother Rob has worked here in the area, and he says that Amentra would be one of two places that he&#8217;d want to work if he were going to go the consulting route.  While I might prefer a regular position in a company, I can&#8217;t argue with the recruitment process so far.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been told to expect a call sometime today from the recruiter to help me set up a meeting with the <span class="caps">CEO</span>.  He should have a job offer and details of my first assignment, if I can impress him enough.  Here&#8217;s hoping!</p>
