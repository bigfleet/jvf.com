  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by my friend <a href="http://socialmemorycomplex.net/2010/10/30/scaling-up-without-growing/">Jeremy&#8217;s recent thoughts on co-working</a>, I wanted to take a moment to briefly outline my own thoughts on the benefits of co-working, and especially what I&#8217;d love to see from the trend.</p>

<p>At the Web 2.0 summit in 2006, when EC2 had not yet <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20100727_clouded_by_a_convenient_illusion/">redefined what Cloud meant</a>, Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2006/12/20/web-20-bezos.html">refers to &#8220;muck&#8221; and &#8220;undifferentiated heavy lifting&#8221; that takes up to 70% of the time you spend on your idea</a>.  He&#8217;s speaking, of course, about a platform that will make him and his company extremely wealthy, as it enables a raft of startups&#8211; a platform based on elasticity of compute and disk resources.</p>

<p>As software development consultants, Jeremy and I both spend our professional careers utilizing compute and disk resources.  The Cloud, whatever it means now, is a part of our professional lives.  We are among the few (<a href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/crispen.htm">we happy few</a>) who can differentiate what Jeff Bezos characterizes as &#8220;undifferentiated&#8221;.  As a businessman who will have <a href="http://itsbspoke.com/">two</a> <a href="http://mocksup.com">startups</a> survive their first year as profitable companies, I have a different feeling about undifferentiated work.</p>

<p>As a software consultant, I am in constant need of contracts and legal review.  When I searched for a retainer contract, the results were terrible.  Further, when you use documents that you find on the Internet, it&#8217;s clear that your enterprise is unlikely to get the upper hand during litigation, as you&#8217;ve had no counsel.</p>

<p>Although Jeremy intimates that taxes are something for which &#8220;tools exist&#8221; that cost &#8220;pennies a day&#8221;, this has not been my experience.  I believe a good CPA is essential to any young business, and yet they seem to take pleasure in not being differentiated.  CPA&#8217;s evoke the first lines of <i>Anna Karenina</i>: every good one is the same, but the bad ones are all different&#8211; unique in their particular brand of incompetence.</p>

<div class='jvf-sidebar'>
<h3>Unhappy Cubicle Code Monkeys</h3>
<p>That cliche turns my stomach after Chad Fowler&#8217;s incomparable <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> makes it clear how both of those situations are the programmer&#8217;s own responsibility.</p>
<p>You want recognition for your work?  Earn it.  Make it impossible to miss your impact on your business.</p>
<p>You want to be better understood?  Go spend the time communicating with the people who matter: those in your organization.  Many programmers feel that management doesn&#8217;t speak their language.  Why shouldn&#8217;t you have to speak management language?  I understand the arguments, but I don&#8217;t think this question is widely considered, and it harms developer&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>Just because it&#8217;s common in our community to be victimized by the processes that I believe Jeremy would claim are inherent in all industries doesn&#8217;t make it any more desirable or acceptable.</p>
</div>

<p>One point that I feel Jeremy is very right to point out is the benefit of low overhead of our industry.  It removes one element of the many that keep &#8220;code monkeys&#8221; tied to cubicles in jobs where they are under-appreciated and misunderstood.  There are many others.  How will I find work?  How will I keep it once I have it?  I don&#8217;t know any lawyers.  None of the lawyers I know do business contract law.  I don&#8217;t know any good CPA&#8217;s.  I don&#8217;t know anyone who knows any good CPA&#8217;s.  How will I manage my time working from home with the distractions there?  I hate timecards!  How much am I going to have to pay for insurance for my family?  Obama, Obama, Obama!  The list could be endless, and its effect is to chain developers to those unhappy cubicles.</p>

<p>I feel, as Jeremy does, that co-working can address many of these questions.  While I feel that the ideas he proposes may require no encompassing formal entity, I think there exists a model for a company that does have formal structure to provide different benefits that directly address the above concerns.  It can lower the overall costs of what are typically large one-time or annual expenses, as well as provide a convenient payment scheme for freelancers and small development shops.  It can provide access to group health care over time.  It can optionally provide many related services, as <a href="http://asksunday.com">Ask Sunday</a> or <a href="https://itsbspoke.freshbooks.com/refer/www">Freshbooks</a> might, either directly or through discount codes.  It can provide professional community, not just in the physical world, but in the connected virtual one.  In other words, some undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p>

<p>The element I&#8217;m most excited about is that of having membership equate to ownership.  With a proper set of bylaws and founding members, I believe it can be demonstrated that two concerns of freelancers and small shops can be addressed in meaningful ways.  Most developers are used to receiving a predictable sum every (say) two weeks.  This is unlikely how they&#8217;ll be paid by their clients.  By collecting receivables jointly, and distributing among all owners, it can function much in the way a credit union does from day to day.  It can provide a payroll service that allows developers to just get the direct deposits and have less to worry about when it comes to managing receivables.  As the concept matures, I believe that paid, &#8220;workless weeks&#8221; can be introduced to those who are billing enough.  There is a set of numbers to be cracked, and I don&#8217;t even know any lawyers that would be up for this, so I can&#8217;t really move the needle farther than this.  But it&#8217;s a great idea.  If you use it, let me know, and I&#8217;ll sign up and sit on the board.</p>
