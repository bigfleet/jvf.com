But that doesn&#8217;t stop him from getting it on with three different people during the book, and that&#8217;s not even all.  His grandparents were brother and sister, and they bump uglies on frame in this one as well.

	<p>It&#8217;s not all about sex, but that&#8217;s definitely the main topic.  He&#8217;s come a long way from The Virgin Suicides (on my all-time top ten, by the way) where you felt like the trees weren&#8217;t the only things rotting from the inside.  All that subtle unpleasantness is gone for this story.  We&#8217;ll be getting all the unpleasantness front and center this time.</p>


	<p>The narrator is a wonderful creation, and the characters seem as real as any you&#8217;ll encounter.  You&#8217;re introduced to him, but you grow up with her.  And they&#8217;ve both seen a lot.</p>


	<p>This book is exceptional, and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone with an inclination to read for pleasure.  My only complaint was that especially by the end, we&#8217;ve had enough coincidental, dramatic happenings that the end seems more implausable than it should.  I give it a .4 deduction, because it was worse than <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000074.php">The Return of the King</a>, but just barely.</p>
