<blockquote>
I think it is very important for you to do two things: act on your temporary conviction as if it was a real conviction; and when you realize that you are wrong, correct course very quickly. And try not to get too depressed in the part of the journey, because there&#8217;s a professional responsibility. If you are depressed, you can&#8217;t motivate your staff to extraordinary measures. So you have to keep your own spirits up even though you well understand that you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.</blockquote>

	<p>I&#8217;m in a position at work where it&#8217;s time to grab my hardhat and get to the work of managing.  The complication is that the people I&#8217;m working with both, technically, outrank me.  I&#8217;m building a hedge fund at work, which is a project which plays directly to my strengths and education.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve faced some recent difficulty, however, and I&#8217;ve seen enough to believe that the best solution is for me to make sure that my beliefs get out there.  I think my concerns are the most useful match with the external shareholders, and fortunately I think that a little more rigor is what the project needs.  So it&#8217;s time to step up.  This is playing directly to my weakness.  I like my hubris well-contained normally.</p>


	<p>The above quote really resonated with me, and I hope it&#8217;s right, because that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m trying to do.</p>
