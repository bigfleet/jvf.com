<p>No matter how you know me or have come to find this page, I would appreciate it if you would take <a href="http://friends.cisv.org/survey/47512444/index.cfm">this brief survey</a>.  It&#8217;s about an organization for which I care very deeply, <a href="http://www.cisv.org/"><span class="caps">CISV</span></a>.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CISV</span> is a wonderful organization with a clear mission: to create peace through the education of children aged 11 to 18 by exposing them to different cultures in neutral environment and caring guidance from adult leaders.  I have been a part of this organization since I was 11 years old.  The world needs our organization more than ever before, and I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could help us get a better idea of how to present our organization to those that have never heard of us before.</p>
