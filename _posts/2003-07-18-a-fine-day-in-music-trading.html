<p>They won&#8217;t end up on <a href="http://db.etree.org/bigfleet">my list</a> for some time yet, but as a combination of downloading and the mail yesterday, these show got added to my incoming shows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Coldcut, DJ Food, and <span class="caps">DJ Z</span>-Trip 12-25-00, Solid Steel Radio</li>
<li>DJ Krush 12-4-01, Live in Rochester, NY</li>
<li>DJ Shadow and DJ Krush, 10-11-95, Live in Leeds</li>
<li>A Tribe Called Quest,  11-24-98</li>
<li>Black Eyed Peas, 12-14-02</li>
<li>De La Soul, 10-28-01</li>
<li>Del The Funkee Homosapien, 11-22-2002</li>
<li>Outkast 7-31-2001</li>
</ul>

	<p>This doesn&#8217;t even include some shows that came in that turned out to be <span class="caps">MP3</span> sourced.   Some of those are new to eTree, which makes me happy.  Any one of those shows above would have made the day feel like a success, so having all of them come in at once was very exciting to me.</p>


	<p>I do have plans for a healthy subsystem of links to musical acts.  In another month, I should be done with my contracting projects, allowing my free time to be my free time.  (Won&#8217;t <strong>that</strong> be something!)  Then I&#8217;ll at least have some time to think about it and see what I can do.  I am definitely all about spreading the musical love.</p>
