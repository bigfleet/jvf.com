<p>I&#8217;m up at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/2004-11-reston/index.jsp">No Fluff Just Stuff symposium</a> where I just spent about an hour drinking with Dave Thomas.  For the last twenty minutes or so, I was actually helping him hype his Ruby For Java Programmers course.  Quite an good feeling!</p>


	<p>The networking has been the most positive part of the conference so far.  Second place was Dave&#8217;s talk on state machines, although I personally may have a little work to go before I&#8217;m ready to use that in my toolkit.  I left the Mock Objects talk knowing <strong>exactly</strong> what to do, but not so this time.  Java Server Faces seems usable to me, but only just.  That&#8217;s a lot of thinking and a lot of typing to get what you&#8217;d like.  It&#8217;s clear that the pressure was on Sun to get something out to be a &#8220;standard&#8221; when it wasn&#8217;t quite ready.  <strong><span class="caps">AAARRGH</span>!</strong></p>


	<p>Erik Hatcher&#8217;s talk on Lucene was a good one.  I simply have no need for the technology as yet, but I&#8217;m glad I stayed to hear about the basic decision matrix, and the single most important topic to think about when deciding to use Lucene.</p>


	<p>Details on this issues will all come later.  For now, I&#8217;m going to brush my teeth and hit the hay.</p>
