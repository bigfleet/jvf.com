<p>This presentation was one of the highlights of the conference to me.  For me, it was a perfectly structured talk.  It joins the <a href="/2007/5/24/railsconf-writeups-when-v-is-for-vexing">V is for Vexing</a>, <a href="/2007/6/1/railsconf-writeups-joyent-happy-hour">Joyent Happy Hour</a>, and the make_resourceful talk as the overall highlights of the conference for me.  (make_resourceful link coming soon!)</p>


	<p>In my experience, there are a lot of developers who are learning Ruby by programming in Rails.  Most of us know that Rails takes a lot of advantage of the advanced metaprogramming techniques in Ruby, but how many of us take the time to learn all the mechanics of how it works?  What made <a href="http://interblah.net/2007/5/20/the-dark-art-of-rails-plugins">this talk</a> so effective was that James was able to take a part of Rails that a lot of developers have to interact with (plugins) and explaining some of the Ruby magic behind how it all comes together.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;re left with a very solid understanding of how everything works behind the scenes.  As a result, you&#8217;re in a much better position to be able to write your own plugins, but also how to be a good plugin consumer.  Don&#8217;t waste any more time listening to me, <a href="http://assets.interblah.net/The_Dark_Art_of_Rails_Plugins_RailsConf_2007.pdf">download the talk</a> and check it out.</p>
