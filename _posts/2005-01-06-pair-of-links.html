<ul>
<li>You can register your birthday <a href="http://www.BirthdayAlarm.com/dob/33549572a414605176b363 ">here</a>.  I found this in a stack of e-mail that Elizabeth sent me when I was looking for her birthday.  It&#8217;s a way to externalize the biennial &#8220;collect then misplace everyone&#8217;s birthday&#8221; initiative, so maybe I have a chance to break the cycle.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.43things.com/">43 things</a> orginally came to my attention because of the technologies the site uses underneath, but it&#8217;s a really neat idea that they&#8217;ve executed well.  The premise is to choose 43 things that you want to do with your life.  Just visit, though, and you&#8217;ll feel that &#8220;community&#8221; feeling right away.</li>
