<p>I got an <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/iRiver_iHP_120/4505-6490_7-30571493.html">iRiver iHP-120</a> the other day at Comp-USA.  I used a $25 gift card that my dad got last Christmas and gave to me.  It didn&#8217;t come cheap, but it&#8217;s <strong>the hotness.</strong></p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll probably have a full review in mind when I come back from <span class="caps">NYC</span>, but my initial impressions are all quite favorable.</p>
