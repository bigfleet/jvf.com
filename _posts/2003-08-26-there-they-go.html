<p>I put the <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/comics.html">comic collection</a> up on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;item=2189356080&#38;category=3983&#38;rd=1">eBay</a>.  I kept a reserve price, since we took the moving quote that would let me take them without costing any extra money.  Maybe they&#8217;ll be worth it in another 50 years&#8230;  <i>(sigh&#8230;)</i></p>
