<p>Here at work, some of our legacy code has the problem of primitive <span class="inlineCode">double</span> and <span class="inlineCode">float</span> primitives turning into scientific notation when they are concatenated to a String.  Hence, a <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement ends up trying to use numbers with letters in them, and that&#8217;s not going to work.</p>

<p>The solution is to use your friend the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html">java.text.NumberFormat</a> class.  After using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html#setGroupingUsed(boolean)">setGroupingUsed(boolean)</a> and the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html#setMaximumIntegerDigits(int)">setMaximumIntegerDigits(int)</a> methods, my problems were over.</p>

<p>After I combed through all the code, bumping my way into places it was used.  See the next quickie.</p>
