<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  2003 was the worst year ever.  While, technically, Erin died in 2002, 99.9% of dealing with it happened in 2003.  And now Jesse is gone.  We went to war.  Tennessee lost the Peach Bowl, got shafted and had to go back again.</p>


	<p>So I&#8217;m eager to start a New Year, to have things start to get better.  But how can it be happy?  Maybe it&#8217;s just one of those moods for me, but I&#8217;ve been highly productive the past couple of days, and normally that makes me pretty sunny.</p>


	<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll <strong>never</strong> be happy about the New Year rolling around, just because of what happened last time.  I heard that &#8220;it&#8217;s not the letting go that hurts, it&#8217;s the holding on that hurts.&#8221;  This is, frankly, a load of crap.  The fact is that they both hurt, but maybe it depends on who you are.</p>


	<p>I heard the holidays are supposed to be bad anyway.  I&#8217;m just lucky I had a chance to be with my family.  Alone?  Yeah, that wouldn&#8217;t have gone well.</p>


	<p>So, anyway, I&#8217;m going to do my best to be super-productive in 2004.  For me, anyway.  I&#8217;ve been working on a system to manage my own behavior in a way that I&#8217;ll be likely to use it instead of just agonize over it and eventually discard it.  Part of what I get points for is sharing it with everyone here, so you know you are all in my thoughts.</p>


	<p>Drinking didn&#8217;t even work for me today.  <i>sigh</i></p>
