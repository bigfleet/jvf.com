<ul>
	<li>I am doing a lot of stuff right now, and so the blog is suffering.  Isn&#8217;t that just the way of things?</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Megan enjoyed her birthday very much, thanks mostly to a ring I got her that exceeded any expectation I had of how good it might be.  Besides the ring, though, I&#8217;m just glad it made her happy.  She certainly reported the reaction I was looking for from her friends and students.  She fielded the &#8220;When are you going to get married?&#8221; questions as best she could, although she was happy to pass those same questions along to me.  I am still working on the answer.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am totally in love with XM Radio.  I&#8217;m learning about when my favorite artists come out with new albums, finding out about new artists I like but have never heard of (e.g. Something For Rockets), and, uh, listening to more dance music.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Mogwai was an excellent show.  Thank god I was able to get Megan her earplugs.  I am reminded once again, though, that I am getting older.  The show was over at just after midnight, and we had to stop twice on the way home to catch quick naps.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The new oven is incredible.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>If Oprah was looking to call James Frey out, she obviously didn&#8217;t read My Friend Leonard;  I&#8217;d be shocked if truths outnumbered fictions in that book.  What a crock of horseshit.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/">Art DeVany</a> didn&#8217;t need very much time to start blogging again after his wife passed away. Not that it was a surprise to me. He is an extremely interesting fellow.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am using <a href="http://www.feedlounge.com/">FeedLounge</a> to keep up with the blogosphere, and it&#8217;s doing a fantastic job.  My Dreamhost referrals pay for it, so I get to enjoy the fruits of my residuals.  If you are interested in a web host, I will be glad to outline the plusses and minuses of the ones with which I am familiar.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am wishing that my notecard system for Getting Things Done would have held up, but I just keep losing them.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to wait until I get Palm-like functionality from my cell phone.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I got a Nintendo DS with Metroid Pinball, Tetris DS, and the Castlevania game.  Totally sweet.  I am a Nintendo fan at heart, and the new Zelda game is going to be ridiculous.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am not playing around with Ruby too much at the moment, but I was encouraged when Don from work asked to take the Pickaxe home with him.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> The &#8220;test-your-might-for-free&#8221; server I acquired from Sun found a happy recipient in Don, as well.  I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s taking the captaincy of the &#8220;blog about beating the hell out of this server and we might let you keep it&#8221; project.  I really don&#8217;t have room for any more.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I had an interesting dinner with <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/">Jeremy</a> the other week</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I am working on getting a geek dinner set up for here in Richmond, but details are still being worked out before I announce it.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> The nutty geek order I talked about last time was hoodwink.d and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really all that cool.  A totally sweet undertaking technically, and why? is pretty much awesome regardless.  I was happy to learn about XPath, though, that&#8217;s a useful trick.  I&#8217;ll be very happy when <span class="caps">XHTML</span> is the only way to go.  Well-formedness is nice.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m adding more gear to my home network.  I got a <span class="caps">NAS</span> device from Buffalo Technolgy that is working quite well so far.  I also finally got printing from Megan&#8217;s iBook over our wireless network to our wireless print server working.  I&#8217;ll try to post a blog about that soon;  It&#8217;s quite hard and there&#8217;s almost 0 good information out there about it.  Help me Google Juice.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>As always, I am a total dork.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li> I think I&#8217;ll be sending my sister a care package in the next few days.  But is she already so bored that she didn&#8217;t read this far?  Only time can say for sure!</li>
	</ul>
