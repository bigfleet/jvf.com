<p>I completed my unbeaten season awhile ago with a convincing victory over the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl.  David Carr finished with league records in TD passes and passer rating.  Corey Bradford set a record with 24 TD catches.  Aaron Glenn set a <span class="caps">NFL</span> record by returning an interception 103 yards for a score.  It was not a pleasant season for the rest of the <span class="caps">NFL</span>.</p>


	<p>Now, for season three.  Exploiting a little bit of a hole in the Madden <span class="caps">CPU</span> owner logic, in week six I traded my first round pick to Arizona for theirs.  So I moved from the 32nd pick to the 3rd, straight up.  I did similar things in the second and third rounds (to different teams).  The Kid refers to the fella I picked up with the third pick.  In a few years, he&#8217;ll be as good as Priest Holmes&#8212;and cheaper.  He&#8217;s got a ton of touchdowns, and watching him catch passes out of the backfield gives my offense an entirely new dimension.  I also got at least three other impact players in the draft: a starting outside linebacker in the second round, an excellent backup strong safety who&#8217;ll see action in some situations in the third round, and a great kick returner in the sixth round.  I haven&#8217;t gotten to the regular season yet, because I have real work to do for a little while.  Oh well!</p>
