<p>After Megan got her new iBook, we were both interested in having wireless in the house.  Since my router has had a cold <em>or something</em> for months, I figured we&#8217;d try to move my router to her place, and I&#8217;d get a new one.  One that worked.</p>


	<p>It happened last night!  I checked my e-mail from my living room!  I love that.</p>


	<p>Also, there was apparently a piece on the Richmond evening news last night about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">war driving</a>.  I got an apparently useful wireless security system in place, thankfully.</p>
