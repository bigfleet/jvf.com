<p><a href="http://link.p0.com/u.d?EGL-D_PJa0lmpp7=251">Get a free 80-hour TiVo unit</a> when you sign up for a service plan.  I am pretty sure that the first plan is $14.95 a month, and, if you watch TV at all, it&#8217;s an excellent deal.  You can actually watch the shows you want to watch, and the wish-list taping is an incredible way to bulk up the movie collection.  Megan and I have actually canceled Netflix, the experiment has been so successful.</p>
