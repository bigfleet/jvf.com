<p>I reached feature freeze on my first project today.  What a feeling!  Key stakeholder buy-in on Friday of last week, and now the doors are closed.  We launch the first week of June.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be including more details about my project here soon.  For now, I&#8217;ve got to head to the Richmond Braves game that I won tickets to at the last <a href="http://www.richmondjug.com">Richmond <span class="caps">JUG</span></a> meeting.</p>
