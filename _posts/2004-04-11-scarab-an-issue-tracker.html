<p><a title="scarab.tigris.org" href="http://scarab.tigris.org/">Scarab</a> is an issue tracker that I&#8217;m using for the webapp I&#8217;m writing.  I&#8217;ve been quite impressed with it, so far.  I&#8217;m interested to see a project like this sitting on top of other projects I don&#8217;t have any experience with like Turbine and Velocity.  So much to learn!</p>
