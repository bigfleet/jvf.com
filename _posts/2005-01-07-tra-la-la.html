<p>It&#8217;s the quickie updates!</p>

<ul>
<li>Go visit <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">HomeStar Runner</a> if you haven&#8217;t.  Specifically the <em>Teen Girl Squad</em> episodes.  I haven&#8217;t been there in awhile, but I was just reminded about it by a voice in my head.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m feeling really, really great.</li>
<li>I got the orientation at the <span class="caps">YMCA</span> near where I work.  I learned good tips about how to lift weights to achieve my goals.  I had not been doing it <strong>all</strong> wrong, but I wasn&#8217;t nearly as efficient as I could have been.  I can write out what the tips were, if anyone is even reading anymore.  The point is that I&#8217;m in good hands over there.  I also rented a locker and joined a basketball league.</li>
<li>Work is really starting to come together.  The boss lady gave me a lot of validation this week, and we haven&#8217;t really even started to &#8220;break the eggs&#8221; yet, if you will.  At the moment, I&#8217;m working on material I find super interesting in <a href="http://www.westciv.com/style_master/academy/css_tutorial/">Web standards</a> like <span class="caps">XHTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>.  It&#8217;s a way to make pages look pretty without having to bend yourself over backwards to make the desired layout <em>possible</em>.</li>
<li>The pay is good.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m reading books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=jimvanfleetco-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F0671015206%2Fref%3Dpd_pym_ka">The Millionaire Next Door</a> half because I&#8217;m tired of reading books about my subject matter, half because I&#8217;m interested in how to get rich.  The secret: no bling-bling.  Whatever will Puff think?</li>
<li>I got my Palm working again.  It&#8217;s been nice to have it around, especially since I&#8217;m going the &#8220;It&#8217;s-not-a-purse-it&#8217;s-a-messenger-bag&#8221; route so I can always have it around.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to get showered and head to work.</p>
