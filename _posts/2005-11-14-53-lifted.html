	<p>Erin bought me <a href="amazon:B00004TRWE">Fevers and Mirrors</a> on a trip to an independent CD store in downtown Knoxville to which I never returned.  I thought it was an OK record with a bit too much screaming for my tastes.  I recall enjoying one or two songs on the record though, and that&#8217;s sometimes enough to make my radar.</p>


	<p>During my live music trading binge, I happened upon a Conor Oberst show at the Showbox in Seattle, and that was quite enough to download it.  Sometime during the next few months, I actually listened to the version of <a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/bright_eyes_lyrics_3516/lifted_or_the_story_is_in_the_soil,_keep_your_ear_to_the_ground_lyrics_11063/waste_of_paint_lyrics_128286.html"><em>Waste of Paint</em></a> on that record, and I was really intrigued.</p>


	<p>Shortly after that, I downloaded the album <a href="amazon:B00006FRN7">Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground</a> and shortly after that, I bought it.  It still has a good amount of screaming, of which I&#8217;m not generally a fan (although some <a href="amazon:B00000IKS0">notable exceptions exist</a>), and is on one level a confusing album.</p>


	<p><em>Lover I Don&#8217;t Have To Love</em> is sort of a self-loathing treatment of indie rocker love, and it&#8217;s followed by <em>Bowl Of Oranges</em>, one of the most straightforwardly positive songs imaginable.  While, unlike some, I don&#8217;t believe that his lyrics deal directly with his bi-polar nature, the diagnosis after listening to this album is pretty natural.  That would explain some of his ass-hat behavior since becoming famous, probably.</p>


	<p>When I started writing the draft of this post, I initially thought that I had put this album somewhere in the 20&#8217;s.  Sometimes albums end up defining an era of your life; for me, this album defines the fall of 2003, my first in Richmond.     I was still dealing with a lot of grief from Erin&#8217;s death, and really making the first attempts at opening myself to dealing with new people again.  Jesse passed away that December.  And yet I could sense that the seeds of my new life had already been sown, and that I would very much enjoy the future, if I could just find the strength to get there.</p>
