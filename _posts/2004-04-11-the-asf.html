<p>Yesterday, I was talking to my dad, who works in communication for an IT department, but has no technical training.  I mentioned <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat</a>, and he asked me, &#8220;Why would anyone give it away?&#8221;</p>


	<p>I know the original codebase was a gift from Sun, and I can understand why they would want to give it away: to get people writing in Java.  But I was less sure about why <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> would want to.</p>


	<p>Fortunately, on the <a href="http://www.apachenews.org/">Apache News</a> blog, they recently posted <a title="How the ASF works! - The Apache Software Foundation" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html">How the <span class="caps">ASF</span> works! &#8211; The Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>


	<p>In short, they want to give away high quality software.  It&#8217;s their philosophy.  Who are we to argue?</p>
