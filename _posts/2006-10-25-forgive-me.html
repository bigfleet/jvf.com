<p>After spending more and more time with <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>, I&#8217;m more convinced then ever that I need to make the switch for my personal space.  I&#8217;m getting serious this time.  The blog is turning into a <span class="caps">CMS</span> and taking over <a href="http:///www.jimvanfleet.com/">my main domain</a>, which hasn&#8217;t been touched in many, many years.  I&#8217;m working with Mephisto for <a href="http://www.cvreg.org"><span class="caps">CVREG</span></a>, and at work with <a href="http://www.planixonline.com/">Planix</a>.  (Expect more about that application later.)  Custom designs adorn them both, and my mind is sort of racing anyway&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to get carried away, but we&#8217;ll see what I can make happen.  At any rate, please forgive the time lapse between posts as I prepare for tectonic shifts in my hosting arrangements.</p>


	<p>Pursuant to the above, are there any web designers out there willing to barter work product?  I can train you to be truly dangerous to your market with Ruby on Rails.  (Dare to dream, Jim)</p>
