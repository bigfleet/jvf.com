<p>Even before vacation kicks off (so I can try to build up my collection of blog postings once more), I wanted to get a post out there about how I&#8217;m feeling about the technology transition I&#8217;ve been making recently.</p>


	<h2>From Java&#8230;</h2>


	<p>I recently wrapped up the bulk of my involvement with the job I had before I started at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERthought</a>.  I&#8217;ll still be available for training and consultation purposes.  I no longer have weekly visits scheduled.  I&#8217;m not responsible for getting anything implemented, etc.</p>


	<p>That in itself is a good feeling.  I am proud of the product I produced.  The project is being maintained by a developer who had no exposure to Java whatsoever 6 months ago.</p>


	<p>What I have a good chance of remembering as clearly as anything else is the last feature I added.  It took me about six weeks of calendar time to implement something I felt that I could have done with Rails in about two days.  To be clear, there were false starts, and I only got to work on the project for a couple of hours at a time.</p>


	<p>It makes me sad to think, like a best friend from elementary school, my most pleasant days with Java web development might be gone forever.  If we meet again, it likely won&#8217;t be in the best of circumstances.  My old friend will have been on a two-year bender, hanging out with shady programmers who maybe aren&#8217;t out explicitly to corrupt him, but perhaps they just don&#8217;t know any better.  But perhaps it was all my fault!  I would never call on him to go out to the bar with me, where we would used to talk about how we wanted to change the world.  Very sad, indeed.</p>


	<h2>Rails and <span class="caps">AJAX</span></h2>


	<p>Rails is getting my calls, these days.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of exposure to the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and Rails mixture recently, and it&#8217;s one powerful combo.  Rails has server-side elements that make <span class="caps">AJAX</span> easy to use (like <span class="caps">RJS</span> templates) and view elements (e.g. form_remote_tag and link_to_remote) that also make it easy to integrate Prototype-based <span class="caps">AJAX</span> calls without worrying about &#8220;how to do&#8221; <span class="caps">AJAX</span>.    There&#8217;s this feeling I get as I dive more deeply into Rails that once I work with Rails as much as I have with Java, that the (ed. note&#8212;the rest of this sentence is lost forever.)</p>


	<p>For the record, this project will be at one person week on Thursday, and is already five use cases deep.  I&#8217;ve also completely rearranged the domain model twice.  A similar change on a Java project will probably take me a few months calendar time to get right.</p>
