	<p>I installed a poll subsystem, you should see that over on the right.  The first question has to do with the linked article from <span class="caps">ESPN</span>.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I root for womankind against the oppresive elements of mankind all the time, but isn&#8217;t <a href="http://espn.go.com/wnba/news/2003/0722/1584313.html" target="_blank">this</a> taking it a little far?  Leave a comment, vote, whatever.</p>


I&#8217;m scared enough of the <span class="caps">RIAA I</span> took down my music list.  I&#8217;ve been ready to stop trading for a short time, actually, even without their subpoenas.  This reminds me.  There&#8217;s only two reasons to take Latin:  it makes learning any other language a piece of cake, and you can spell words like &#8220;subpoena&#8221; without having to look them up.  I invited a guest author to speak on the topic, maybe he&#8217;ll restore my courage.

I&#8217;m about half way through my next book, look for that review before next week is out.  It&#8217;s been every bit as good as <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000007.php">Wu Li</a>, but  it&#8217;s two or three times as long.  And I can&#8217;t tell you what it is, it&#8217;s a secret.

	<p>I was so stressed about what to do with my Friday night, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier that I spend it talking to friends and getting a couple of things up here.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, the pictures.  I don&#8217;t pretend to have a full grasp of what we&#8217;re doing in Iraq, but I have some theories.  If we do find Saddam, GW is going to have a hell of a time convincing America that our boys still belong over there.  Also, no matter if you agree with our policy or not, why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://www.uso.org/pubs/8_18_23.cfm">donate to the <span class="caps">USO</span></a>.  They don&#8217;t even get to phone home for free, people.</p>
