<p>I upgraded the software that runs this blog in an effort to keep pages other than the main page up for a few hours at a time.  For those of you who may have visited recently and caught the very minimal look, that was because the stylesheets weren&#8217;t working.</p>


	<p>Commenting doesn&#8217;t work with my old theme, so it&#8217;s back to the default look for now.  I&#8217;ll try to find something soon, I don&#8217;t particularly care for this.</p>
