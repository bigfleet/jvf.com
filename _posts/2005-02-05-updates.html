<p>There&#8217;s been some things happening this week.</p>

<ul>
<li>I did a little personal project in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is really killer.  The project is still very <em>secret</em>, so no fair asking.</li>
<li>I did not-too-well in the first basketball game I was in this past week.  0-2 from the floor, but I did get some rebounds.</li>
<li>Lifting weights is going swimmingly.  Ricky, I&#8217;ll get around to posting what my trainer had to say about it at some point.</li>
<li>Speaking of Ricky, I just bought a plane ticket to attend <a href="http://www.rickyandamber.com">his wedding</a>.  Got my hotel, too.  I&#8217;m staying at the La Quinta downtown.</a></li>
<li>I&#8217;m getting ready to cook breakfast.  When I eat at the great breakfast place around the corner, their bacon is way better than their sausage&#8230; but I love sausage!</li>
<li>I gave a nifty presentation on Java at work.  I&#8217;m not quite certain what they are going to ask me to do anymore.  Now <strong>that&#8217;s</strong> an odd situation.  So right now, I&#8217;m working but taking it easy.</li>
</ul>
