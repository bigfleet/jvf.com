<p><a title="Joel on Software - The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel on Software &#8211; The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a> is a link that comes a little late for me.</p>


	<p>Having done the legwork already to track down <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1058081&#38;forum_id=180505">this problem</a>, the information contained there wasn&#8217;t quite as timely as it could have been.  But I&#8217;m still quite appreciative of its existence!</p>


	<p>Also, kudos to <a href="http://www.blogscene.org/erik/LuceneInAction/i18n.html">Erik Hatcher&#8217;s blog</a> for pointing it out to me.  It also contains some other good info there, too.</p>
