<p>I can&#8217;t stand that <a title="Yahoo! News - AP: Bush Leads Kerry in Electoral Votes" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=514&#38;e=1&#38;u=/ap/20040725/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_road_to270">the entire process by which a candidate becomes president in this country</a> can be something that&#8217;s analyzed to the depth that you and I can read articles about it on the Internet.</p>


	<p>What&#8217;s left?  A lot of highly specific, specialized strategy to &#8220;win&#8221;, to get your candidate into the White House.</p>


	<p>When did this stop being about the right thing?  When did this stop being about America?</p>
