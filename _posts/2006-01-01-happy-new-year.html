<h3>Our Party</h3>


	<p>Our Not-A-New-Year&#8217;s bash went swimmingly!  Megan was a superstar in getting the place cleaned up and everything ready.  I pitched in with an assist on some things and helped keep her calm. Friends mixed and mingled and appeared to have a great time.</p>


	<h3>New Year&#8217;s Eve</h3>


	<p>We went to Fredericksburg for New Year&#8217;s Eve.  We hung out with Marta, one of Megan&#8217;s friends.  After having a nice dinner, we went back to Marta&#8217;s place for cookies, South Park, sample questions from her brother&#8217;s multi-state Bar exam prep book and some questionable champagne.</p>


	<p>We walked to downtown Fredericksburg to watch the pear drop, but apparently the pear doesn&#8217;t drop anymore;  they just have a laser light show and a ton of confetti.  I really enjoyed that part of the evening.  We spent the night back home in our bed.</p>
