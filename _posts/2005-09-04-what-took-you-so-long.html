<p>I&#8217;m <em>very</em> excited to be working on a new blog engine named <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">typo</a>. For the first time, my blog is written in an language and platform that I can easily alter, so that the entire blog is a vehicle for expression instead of only the articles.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that I&#8217;ve integrated my two blogs together.  A later post will explain more about my motivations for this.</p>


	<p>If you have been a regular visitor in the past, please read my <a href="http://jvfblog.textdriven.com/pages/about-rss">about <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> page and subcribe to my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed using one of the links on the right.</p>


	<p>And stay tuned for new developments!  I have many in mind.</p>
