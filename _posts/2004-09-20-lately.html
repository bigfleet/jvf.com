<ul>
<li>I stepped back up onto the 360 highwire to deliver a major change to the reports on a short deadline.</li>
<li>I created a simple <span class="caps">HTML</span>+CSS website for the first time in years.  You can learn some interesting techniques at the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Zen Garden</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> are both excellent reference material.  <span class="caps">CSS2</span> is probably the most wonderful thing to happen on the web <strong>since</strong> HTML.</li>
<li>Doing a bit of work for <a href="http://www.ideaweavers.com">IdeaWeavers</a> clients to keep the bills paid and the leaks plugged.</li>
<li>Taking further steps on my project to tie together <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/salmon"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a>, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a>.  The first unit tests covering page controller behavior have been written.  Soon, it&#8217;ll be time to write an actually difficult test.</li>
</ul>
