<p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">OS X</span> on my new MacBook Pro for some time now, and I&#8217;m elated with it.  I have used <span class="caps">OS X</span> before, at Rice.  At that time, it was the only computer that I could do everything I would ever need to do from.  I&#8217;m over that, this time around.  I needed to be able to do even more, and <span class="caps">OS X</span> did not let me down.  I have had to pay a lot for software this time around, but we&#8217;ll get into that in a later post.</p>


	<h2>What I Run</h2>


	<h3>Web Browsing (and <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet">del.icio.us</a>) posting</h3>


	<p><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> and <a href="http://protagonist.co.uk/dashLicious/">dashLicious</a> are my preferred combo here, although I do run Firefox right now for GMail.  I may try out BonEcho, but my computer hasn&#8217;t shied under the load so far, so running two browsers is OK by me.  Camino delivers a Firefox level of browsing quality almost always, and pairs perfectly with dashLicious, which is kind enough to be browser agnostic.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a></h3>


	<p>Quicksilver is the majordomo for <span class="caps">OS X</span>.  &#8220;Albert, open my newsreader!&#8221;, &#8220;Albert, send this file over IM to my friend <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net">Jeremy</a>!&#8221;  Quicksilver has most of its functionality tied to Apple software, but plugins are available.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploadr</a></h3>


	<p>I use <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for my photosharing needs, and you can view the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigfleet">bigfleet photostream</a> to check it out yourself.  The tools are so much better than uploading directly using the web interface, it&#8217;s kind of a joke that I ever used the web in the first place.</p>


	<p>If you use Flickr, this tool is a must download.</p>


	<h3>Google Notifier and GMail Macros</h3>


	<p>The whole reason that I run two browsers is that the combination of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> and <a href="http://blog.persistent.info/2005/12/greasemonkey-christmas.html">GMail Macros</a> is so powerful.  The real inspiration for this post is that I have finally reached an empty inbox on GMail after clearing out nearly 2600 unread messages.  You can fly through tagging, archiving, and deleting messages with barely any time at all.  It really facilitates the sort of session that is advocated in Getting Things Done.</p>


	<p><a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html">Google Notifier</a> does the job of letting me know when I have new mail.  It also lets me know if I have just read a piece of mail (by displaying a &#8220;new&#8221; entry in the ten newest unread messages list) which is annoying but still worth it.</p>


	<h3>Handbrake, iSquint and Lostify</h3>


	<p>Just <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?p=305">read this</a> if you have an iPod.</p>


	<h3>NeoOffice</h3>


	<p>Even if <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a> is slow to start up, you can&#8217;t beat free.  Maybe the new iWork releases are awesome, though, and they&#8217;ll be worth paying for.</p>


	<h3>SSHKeychain</h3>


	<p>If you use <span class="caps">SSH</span> a lot, you can use <a href="http://scoops.totallyrule.com/articles/2005/10/25/sshkeychain">SSHKeychain</a> to stop typing your passwords.  If you&#8217;re like me, that actually makes a big difference.</p>


	<h3>Adium</h3>


	<p>Although I really wish that either <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> would work with Quicksilver or Yahoo would work with iChat, since neither of those seems to be imminent, it&#8217;s Adium for me.  Although I did get laid off, so I&#8217;m not really required to use Yahoo! IM anymore, so the iChat door is open again.</p>


	<h3>CocoaMySQL</h3>


	<p>MySQL is my favored database, and <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/index.html">CocoaMySQL</a> is my favorite interface to it on <span class="caps">OS X</span>.</p>


	<h3>Transmission</h3>


	<p>For BitTorrent on the Mac, my favorite application is <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a> although <a href="http://www.bitrocket.org/">BitRocket</a> shows a lot of promise.</p>


	<h3>Colloquy</h3>


	<p><span class="caps">IRC</span> is taken care of by <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a>.  It&#8217;s the best <span class="caps">IRC</span> client that I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>


	<p>Have fun with this!</p>
