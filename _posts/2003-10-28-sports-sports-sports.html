<p>The third Madden season ended up undefeated, the second one in a row.  I wasn&#8217;t making it a goal, it just worked out that way.  In the fourth season, I&#8217;ve faced my first real difficulty as a GM, having to let go two or three of the major players.  Aaron Glenn was a real loss.  I traded down my first round pick for a Gary Walker replacement, and the pick that became Kris Brown&#8217;s replacement.  All those replacements are headed to the Pro Bowl, even though it doesn&#8217;t even look like Glenn&#8217;s replacement is the best corner on my team, on paper.</p>


	<p>Once again, my live drafted fantasy football teams have tanked.  I&#8217;m wondering if I should even continue trying.  Also, with my pick &#8216;em record this year, I&#8217;m considering that gambling thing&#8230;  Oh, who am I kidding.  Isn&#8217;t that illegal?</p>


	<p>I still haven&#8217;t heard any sportswriter mention that the Marlins paid Mike Hampton $10 million to pitch for the Braves this year.  Isn&#8217;t that like twenty percent of their payroll?  Is anyone going to watch Marlin baseball next year?  I don&#8217;t have these answers.</p>


	<p>Is it me, or was this one of the most exciting post-seasons in recent history?  The post season went a grand total of three games under the maximum.  There were folds and great performances along the way, lots of exciting storylines&#8230;  Yet for some reason I really didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as I might have.  I remember the Marlins and Indians series being more exciting.</p>


	<p>Is it time for basketball already?  I&#8217;m not ready!  Can&#8217;t we just cancel the season already?  Or maybe get rid of like half the teams?  I&#8217;m watching this season under protest.</p>


	<p>For all the shit that people are talking about the Eagles, they&#8217;re one game back in the <span class="caps">NFC</span> East.  Don&#8217;t sportscasters look at the standings?</p>


	<p>I like Brent Jones in the booth.  I like Michael Irvin in the commentator&#8217;s chair.  I really don&#8217;t have an opinion on Rush&#8217;s politics (besides thinking he&#8217;s a comedian), but his sports commentary was wanting.</p>


	<p>I think that&#8217;s it.</p>
