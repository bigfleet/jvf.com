<p>I&#8217;ve been doing some looking around at some various technical topics, and here are the results.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Back to Reston</dt>
<dd><p>I am going to attend the November <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/"><span class="caps">NFJS</span></a> conference in Reston in early November.  I&#8217;m interested to see the new workshops, this get together promises to be just as interesting as the first.  Maybe I&#8217;ll try to be more sociable.</p></dd>
<dt>Tapestry Demoted to <span class="caps">AAA</span></dt>
<dd><p>I think that <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com/archives/000016.html">Tapestry</a> has found its way to the minors.  I was reading Tapestry In Action, and the much-discussed learning curve simply seems too steep.  There&#8217;s a very important Tapestry construct called &#8220;rewind mode&#8221; that places specific restrictions on how the end developer codes.  At some point, we&#8217;ve all got to turn the works over the code monkeys (after first being one ourselves) and I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll work.
</p><p>
If you have a smart team, maybe it&#8217;ll be fine for you.  I certainly don&#8217;t want to say anything derogatory, but it does not seem to fit my needs.  I may, at some point, decide that the speed with which a new web page is developed doesn&#8217;t matter, but it can&#8217;t be right now.  </p></dd>
<dt>No Echo</dt>
<dd><p>I checked out the <a href="http://www.nextapp.com/products/echo/">Echo</a> framework, which is totally unsuitable.  I expect to put massive amounts of JavaScript and top-notch <span class="caps">HTML</span> designs in our pages; Echo is simply a non-starter with this requirement.  You will think that you are coding a <span class="caps">SWING</span> app.  </p><p>
<a href="http://echopoint.sourceforge.net/">EchoPoint</a> and its <a href="http://echopoint.sourceforge.net/LinkedArticles/CascadingStyleSheets.html"><span class="caps">CSS</span> support</a> look good, but specifying <span class="caps">CSS</span> texts in Java code does not seem like a good solution to me.  You wouldn&#8217;t put <span class="caps">HTML</span> text in Java code, and I see only a subtle difference between the two.  Looks like I&#8217;ll have to check out Java Server Faces next.  I somehow have a feeling we&#8217;ll be ending up with Spring <span class="caps">MVC</span> and a lot of custom code writing.</p></dd>
<dt>It&#8217;s a Gem</dt>
<dd><p>I&#8217;ve been fiddling with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, motivated by the support of the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a>, and the very impressive video demo of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/show/HomePage">Rails</a>, which is worth downloading Quicktime to watch, if you&#8217;re into web applications.    I love <span class="caps">OS X</span>, but I don&#8217;t have it.  I&#8217;m trying to bluff my way through a Windows / CygWin installation and it is not pretty.  More updates when I have them.</p></dd>
