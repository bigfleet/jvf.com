<p><a title="Hibernate - Hibern8IDE" href="http://www.hibernate.org/190.html">Hibernate &#8211; Hibern8IDE</a> has recently hit 1.0 or 0.9, depending on where you&#8217;re looking at the moment.  Regardless, it&#8217;s an excellent product.  One of the features I appreciated about Dreamweaver was quick and dirty <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement editing.  This can bring the same features to Hibernate use, only now the queries are much more powerful!</p>
