<p>Last Friday, I was offered a position at Dominion Medical.  I accepted!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a six month contract to hire position that I found through Robert Half Technology.  The task is to <strong>eventually</strong> do web application development.  For now, the job is to produce a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; web application that&#8217;s very limited in scope.  This will illuminate the kind of work that will be involved in the full project.</p>

<p>If I get hired at the end of six months, I&#8217;m likely to end up with some sort of title like &#8220;Director of Web Application Development&#8221; at a Fortune 1000 company.  It&#8217;s a huge opportunity, and I&#8217;m very excited about the possibilities.</p>

<p>Bill took it well, and I&#8217;m finishing up one element that I have nearly completed.  After that, I&#8217;ll be checking in with him to see if there&#8217;s bits and pieces that I can do for him.</p>
