<p>So, I&#8217;m back from Maryville.  It was a great trip.  I had a blast hanging out with Jess and Jenn.  I can tell Jenn appreciated my visit because she must have thanked me fifteen times on the ride back from a party on Saturday night.  If you&#8217;re reading this, really, it was my pleasure.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m planning on getting back sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I&#8217;d love to go down every weekend, but looks like I&#8217;ll have to work on some of them coming up!</p>
