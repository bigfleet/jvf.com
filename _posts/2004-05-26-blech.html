<p><a title="ESPN.com - NCF - Ex-Rice players: Recruits taken to strip joints" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1808659">This article</a> about a Rice recruit being taken to strip clubs makes me sick.  I don&#8217;t know what the atmosphere&#8217;s like at Colorado or Missouri, but I do know what it&#8217;s like at Rice.</p>


	<p>Students who go there are expected to know better.  And I couldn&#8217;t be more sure that the coach and AD are telling the truth when they say they knew nothing about it.</p>


	<p>This guy went to a strip club, got kicked out, points the finger, and is now on <span class="caps">ESPN</span>.  Give me a break.</p>
