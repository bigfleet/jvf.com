<p>Those of you uninterested in geek talk can just skip this post entirely.</p>


	<p>Several months after <a href="http://www.cvreg.org/projects/lucid-for-mephisto">porting a theme to Mephisto</a>, I finally had a chance to adopt it for myself.  I was getting incredibly behind on my blogging, mostly due to continued random Typo outages and the Typo trunk being unprepared to handle them combined with a sudden aversion to dealing with that particular problem.</p>


	<p>Well, I just jumped in with both feet.  I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot of behind the scenes work on the blog, hopefully that&#8217;ll just make it nicer to deal with over time.  I hope to be posting more frequently now.</p>
