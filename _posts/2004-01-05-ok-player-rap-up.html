<p>The show itself was tight.  Skillz was awesome, the highlight of the night.  I would jump at the chance to go see Skillz as a headliner.  When he stepped on stage to rap that first joint, it was <i>tiiiight</i>, and the CD&#8217;s I picked up of his seem to indicate that he has the material to pull it off.  Rumor is that he&#8217;s leaving Rawkus as well.</p>


	<p>Jean Grae was incredible as well, I got albums from them both.  J-Live was awesome, but I have his rekkids.  Vast Aire had a sore throat and couldn&#8217;t go.  Everyone on OK Player forums was talking up Little Brother.  They were enjoyable and all that, and they did their jobs, but I didn&#8217;t feel it all that much.  Everyone talks bad about the Def Jux performance.  Sure, it wasn&#8217;t the same crunk level as everything else&#8212;but I guess these people are used to dancing for three hours straight.  I have to have a little bit of down time myself.</p>


	<p>As for my plans to tape, I at least have all the gear now, and I actually asked the sound guys about it.  I forgot my permission slip from <a href="http://btat.wagnerone.com"><span class="caps">BTAT</span></a>, though, so that was as far as I got.  Someday&#8212;maybe My Morning Jacket at the Canal Club at the end of the month.</p>
