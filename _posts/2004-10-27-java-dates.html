<p>When you&#8217;re working with String objects and need to end up storing your work in a Datetime field in the database, remember that the <a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?thread=539088&#38;forum=48&#38;message=2612033">default <span class="caps">JDBC</span> date format</a> is <span class="caps">YYYY</span>-MM-DD.</p>
