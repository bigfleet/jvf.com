<p>First, I got my <a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/products/H120.aspx">iRiver H-120</a> back as a warantee replacement.   I had kind of stopped using it at one point, but now I&#8217;m very excited to have it back.  The music database project hit a bit of a snag, but one that&#8217;s involved in making it look and work a lot better.  So I&#8217;m doing a bit of slogging through that in the spare time that I have.</p>


	<p>If only I could get motivated!  I&#8217;ve had some serious personal velocity issues lately, the kind of which I haven&#8217;t battled in quite some time.</p>


	<p>Of course, I did go up to the DC area last night to watch Dave Thomas give a talk to the Northern Virginia Java User&#8217;s Group.  (Normally, I&#8217;d link that, but I am 100% certain that 0% of my audience cares!)</p>


	<p>Jordan Pearce (getting married Jordan) is having his e-mail bounce, so now I&#8217;m going to have to log in to <span class="caps">AIM</span> sometime today and try to catch him that way.</p>


	<p>Bill gets back from his trip up north today.  That means we&#8217;re in for some debriefing.  Hopefully we&#8217;ll start to get me interested and motivated in something, because I&#8217;m having trouble doing the job I&#8217;m working on right now.</p>
