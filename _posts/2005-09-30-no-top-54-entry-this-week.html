<p>Apologies for being too tied up to get a review out this week.  I had a good excuse, I promise.</p>


	<p>In exchange, I&#8217;ll mention what I&#8217;m listening to these days.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ironandwine.com/">Iron And Wine</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ENX54/jimvanfleetco-20">Our Endless Numbered Days</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>&#8216;Passing Afternoon&#8217; is an absolutely gorgeous song.  Kudos to Megan&#8217;s friend Marta for making the recommendation that broke the camel&#8217;s back.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.antonyandthejohnsons.com/">Antony And The Johnsons</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000777J2S/jimvanfleetco-20">I Am A Bird Now</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.pitchfork-media.com/">Pitchfork</a>&#8212;they may be snotty, but they do like good music.  This record is quite unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever heard, but I like it.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s all for now!</p>
