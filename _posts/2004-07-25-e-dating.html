<p>As fascinating as the word <a href="http://elimidate.warnerbros.com/?frompage=sitemap">ElimiDate</a> is&#8212;being a proper noun (ElimiDate, show), common noun (ElimiDate, the activity of being <strong>on</strong> an ElimiDate <i>proper noun</i>), verb (to ElimiDate a contestant) and interjection (ElimiDate!)&#8212;I lend much more credence to the online dating community, of which I can now pick the winners and losers.</p>


	<p>The winners are <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eHarmony</a> and <a href="http://www.okcupid.com">OK Cupid</a>.  The first is quite expensive, the second is free.  Don&#8217;t ask me why it works this way.  But if you choose to check out OK Cupid, definitely let me know your username so we can play the <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> angle there.  If you are an <a href="http://www.yournewromance.com/extroorintroquiz.html">introvert</a>, then definitely check out eHarmony.  Yes, the commercials with the founder are creepy, but there are decent connections to be made out there.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to sleep after I drink a glass or two of water.</p>
