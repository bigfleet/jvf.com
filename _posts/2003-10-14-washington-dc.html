<p>We went up on Sunday morning, stopping at the house of the guy who was hooking us up with the tickets.  We were there long enough to grab a doughnut, then it was off to FedEx field.</p>


	<p>The drive from where we were was really interesting.  We passed by the Washington Mall, and saw many of our nation&#8217;s treasures.  Mom and I were planning on browsing this area the next day, while Dad worked.  It was the first time I had been to DC since I was about fifteen, so that was refreshing.  I wasn&#8217;t into things like looking at maps at that point.</p>


	<p>When we got there, we kind of had to pull one over on the box guards to get three Van Fleet&#8217;s in with two tickets.  I went out to the smoking balcony and waited while my dad went to the box, then came back with Mom&#8217;s pass.  Boom, I was in.</p>


	<p>The game was really enjoyable, but this is now two professional events in a row I&#8217;ve watched <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020809.html">in the box</a>.  That&#8217;s really a whole other kind of event.  Roughly 8.7 seconds after the &#8216;Skins looked like they might be bringing the house down on their heads, the focus became watching as many of the <span class="caps">NFL</span> games as possible.  I&#8217;m down with that.  We all had enough great, free food that we didn&#8217;t even need to eat dinner later.  I&#8217;m just kind of upset that I got a little drunk on our beer the night before so I couldn&#8217;t enjoy the free stuff in the box.</p>


	<p>We watched six innings of Josh Beckett&#8217;s two-hit shutout, and hated every second of it.</p>


	<p>After that, we were at the guy&#8217;s house and had some after-game snacks and dessert.  Yeah, that sounds horrible, huh?  Then it was back to the hotel room to watch fourth season Sopranos and Carnivale.  I really liked the first few episodes of Carnivale, but it&#8217;s gone downhill a bit.  Hopefully it&#8217;ll pick back up; I enjoy my high weirdness.</p>


	<p>The next day, Mom and I hit some museums.  For some reason, I remembered the Air and Space museum having an Omnimax theatre.  I have this memory of watching an Imax movie in the planetarium posture&#8212;almost laying down.  This may not even really exist.  It certainly wasn&#8217;t at the Air and Space museum.  We did a couple of the things around there, but it really wasn&#8217;t that educational.  I&#8217;m sure I could have learned a great deal about war, but that&#8217;s really not an interest of mine.</p>


	<p>The next stop was a great exhibit at the Smithsonian called <a href="http://genome.pfizer.com/">Genome</a>.  It had great depth and breadth into its subjects, and really got my mind going.  I love when that happens.</p>


	<p>After that, we shopped for some clothes, went to dinner, and came back home.  That&#8217;s one enjoyable weekend.</p>
