<p>I&#8217;ve technically been self-employed for quite some time now, so I&#8217;m not technically changing employers;  I still appear to be myself.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be spending most of my time contracting with a fellow who runs a <a href="http://www.ideaweavers.com">local IT shop</a> that sells a particular web application to business clients in the area.  To customers, this application is great.  It performs many, many useful tasks.  To a technical person in charge of working with the application, it needs a lot of work!  Since I happen to <strong>be</strong> a technical person, I see my job as making the code tight enough you could bounce a quarter off of it, then getting rich.</p>


	<p>Taking the contract means significantly fewer responsibilities and significantly more pay.  This is always a good trade!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be sticking with my current contract for a few weeks still.  It&#8217;s not in me to leave anyone high and dry, much less someone who&#8217;s paid my salary for months.  The project has been a success, which is kind of amazing in its own right.  I came in on-time and within budget, which apparently <a href="http://www.it-cortex.com/Stat_Failure_Rate.htm">one in ten IT projects do</a>.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t even see what the coming week will bring, but I know it will be alright.  I haven&#8217;t been this excited since Erin was still with me.</p>
