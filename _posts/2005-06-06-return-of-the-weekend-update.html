<li>Went to the <a href="http://www.gravesmountain.com/bluegrass.htm">Graves Music Festival</a> in <em>get this</em> Syria, Virginia.  Megan and I met up with a bunch of her friends there, and a good time was had by all.  I had my first serious night of drinking in about six weeks, maybe more.  That felt good, but I don&#8217;t feel any particular need to duplicate it.  The company and the music were both really good, but we had to get back the next day so Megan could take her <a href="http://www.battleofthebrains.net/teaser/">Battle of the Brains</a> team.</li>

<li>Worked on the Real Estate application.  The fellows I&#8217;ve been talking to about it are really engaged, which I&#8217;m happy about.  They will be happy to connect me with <a href="http://www.ronlegrand.com/">Ron</a> <a href="http://www.totalrealestatesolutions.com/experts/details.cfm?id=18">LeGrand</a> and help me pitch the product.  That&#8217;s the A+ exit for me on this deal, so it&#8217;s good to know that it should be available when the application is ready.  I&#8217;ve got a pretty good starting place whipped up, and one additional developer interested in working on it with me.  So that&#8217;s going pretty well.</li>

<li>Had breakfast with Ib and the folks.  That&#8217;s always nice.  We tried to go get new cell phones, but we can&#8217;t do that until next week.</li>

<li>Picked out colors for the living room.  We have a darker green, a lighter yellow, an off-white, and a brown.  It looks very nice with some pillows Mom got for me that are on my couch currently.  After this, we&#8217;ll be firming up the details of that room, and picking some colors for the other rooms.</li>

<li>Had a cleaning session.  With two people, this can really make a big difference in a short amount of time.  I&#8217;m hopeful that we can do something really similar tonight as well, as that would really get this place ready to look at.</li>

<li>Put my apartment up on <a href="http://richmond.craigslist.com/apa/77191366.html">craigslist</a>.  Thank god it&#8217;s come to Richmond!</li>
</ul>

<p>This coming week looks to be a big one, so keep your eyes peeled for the next post.</p>
