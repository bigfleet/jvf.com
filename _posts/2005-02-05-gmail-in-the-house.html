<p>I now have 50 invites, so if you know anyone who wants one, you know where to send them.</p>


	<p>Also, if you want to be updated when I post something to the site, let me know, and I can add your e-mail to the list.  I don&#8217;t know why on earth I waited so long to upgrade Movable Type!</p>
