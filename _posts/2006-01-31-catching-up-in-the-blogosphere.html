<h2>James and Oprah</h2>


	<p>When I read an account like <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FreakonomicsBlog?m=257">this one about James Frey and Oprah</a> I wonder what people expect from this guy.  I&#8217;m as concerned about truth as the next person, but I think we&#8217;re looking for it in all the wrong places now.  This man was so messed up that he was one of the hardest cases in rehab.  Is it so important that he recount his background perfectly, or what happened after?  The entire situation was a horrible mess.  I think this book would have done just as well in the Fiction category.  Can imagine what it would be like to have a studio audience sitting there in judgement of you based on your retelling of how an ex-girlfriend killed herself?  I can&#8217;t.</p>


	<h2>Why I Read Blogs</h2>


	<p><a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/">Art DeVany</a>  is an economist blogger, but that&#8217;s not why  I&#8217;m writing about him today.  Not often, but every once in awhile, in the span of a few days, you feel like you can learn everything you need to know about a person.</p>


	<p>His span of posts (<a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/archives/2006/01/its_the_ice_cre.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/archives/2006/01/an_empty_house.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/archives/2006/01/permission.html">3</a>, <a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/archives/2006/01/ella_g_de_vany.html">4</a>,
<a href="http://www.arthurdevany.com/archives/2006/01/bonnie_de_vany.html">5</a>) about the the final arc of his wife of 50 years and the death of his mother is devastating to read, but it is easy to sense his attitude is already appropriate.  There is nothing that can ease the pain of grief, but there are elements in ourselves that can make the problem an intractable one.  I know this won&#8217;t be the problem here.</p>


	<h2>Google, You Aren&#8217;t Half Smart</h2>
