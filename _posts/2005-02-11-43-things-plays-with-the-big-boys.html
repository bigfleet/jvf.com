<p>With my recent interest in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, I learned about <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43 things</a> when it came out.  43 Things is written using that platform.  Today, I got word that <a title="Amazon invests in blogging site | Tech News on ZDNet" href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-5570177.html">Amazon has invested in 43 Things</a>.  Sure, the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of 43 Things used to work there, but there&#8217;s probably something cooking.</p>


	<p>Ruby is a great language, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to me to see if it continues to be a bigger deal.</p>
