<p>So, the trip to New York was up and down.  On the up side, I saw and hung out with Dan.  That was fun, and a real throwback to the old days.  We checked out a Jets game, and man, that was something else.  We showed up at the Meadowlands at about 4:30 and had beers, burgers, and dogs until the game at around 9.  The game itself was something else, very exciting.  I loved our seats, which were under the overhang on the lower deck, right at the fifty yard line.</p>


	<p>I got sick on Thursday and found out that Jesse, my best friend from back home in Maryville died.  I spent all of that day in bed and moving my travel schedule around.  Friday I spent at LaGuardia trying to leave.  Saturday, I actually got to leave on the train, cancelling all my flights and stuff.  More on that next post.</p>


	<p>So overall it was nice.  I hope to make it back sometime, but there&#8217;s a few other places on my list first.</p>
