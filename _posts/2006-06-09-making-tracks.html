<p>I&#8217;ve started using <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a>, an open-source Ruby on Rails app aimed at the <a href="amazon:0142000280">Getting Things Done</a> cult.</p>


	<p><a href="amazon:0142000280">Getting Things Done</a> is a great book, one I have no problem recommending.  Everyone will probably get a little something different out of it, but if you like doing <strong>something</strong>, <strong>anything</strong>, there will be a tip or two for you in there.</p>


	<p>I tried the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/">Hipster <span class="caps">PDA</span></a> as a result, and that didn&#8217;t work out.  I kept leaving my <span class="caps">PDA</span> in random places.  I don&#8217;t even know where the last one ended up!  I think that Tracks has a chance to succeed where that project failed.</p>


	<p>Using the application is very easy.  If you&#8217;ve read the book, you&#8217;ll be familiar with the terminology used, but even if you haven&#8217;t read the book, you can probably figure it out.</p>


	<p>I have my Tracks installation now running on my desktop machine at home.  Setting up the application is straight forward, if you&#8217;ve ever set up a Rails app before.  And thanks to <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS</a> and a little Apache configuration, I can get at my data from the outside world.</p>


	<p>I also have a cron job set up to print out the text version of the to-do list every day.  (That&#8217;s one great feature, by the way)  That gives me a place to write down new tasks when I&#8217;m &#8220;off-line&#8221;.</p>


	<p>If I lose the day&#8217;s paper, there&#8217;s no great loss.  If I lose my deck of cards, however&#8230;</p>


And now I&#8217;m going to cross off two items from today&#8217;s to-dos:
	<ul>
	<li>Post to blog</li>
		<li>Mention <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/10/19/megan-and-me">Megan</a> in blog post</li>
	</ul>
