<p>We hosted Thanksgiving yesterday for the families.  Megan&#8217;s folks came down early, since Megan&#8217;s mom had volunteered for the cooking.  My sister and parents came later, bringing a cheese plate and the wine.</p>


	<p>It was a great meal, and I had a great time.  Everybody seemed comfortable and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company.  That was a great feeling.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thankful for all the gifts that God has given me, and I continue to hope that I am worthy of them.</p>


	<p>Also, thanks everybody for reading my blog.  You should never hesitate to leave comments about anything.</p>
