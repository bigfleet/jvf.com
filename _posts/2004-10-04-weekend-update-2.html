<p>Over the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>After a frustrating day of work on Friday, I got excellent direction from Bill that verified that we&#8217;re nearly always on the same page when it comes to decisions that have impact on both the business interface and technical implementation of what I&#8217;m doing.  This is a huge relief as well as a good deal of validation.  I sure do like my new job.</li>
<li>I zonked out very early on Friday, after cooking my chili for the first time in two months, probably.  I do believe that those events were unrelated.</li>
<li>I woke up early on Saturday, totally refreshed, and got right to work.  and had a &#8220;straightening the place&#8221; morning.   Made lots of progress in the front two rooms and got almost all the dishes done.  It is a gigantic pain not having a dishwasher.</li>
<li>Brunch with Bill went really well.  We chatted about mostly business stuff.</li>
<li>I invited Megan (from <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/">OKCupid</a>) over for the UT vs. Auburn game on Saturday night.  UT was totally destroyed.  That was crap, but me and Megan had a good time anyway.</li>
<li>Even though Sunday was a little lazier, I still got the dishes done, the kitchen clean, my fall clothes and summer clothes co-existing peacefully in my closet, new drawer places selected for appropriate clothes (e.g. sweaters that get pointy shoulders if they don&#8217;t live in drawers), my stuff put up from the flood, and my spare bedding housed in a stackable container in my spare closet.  Hoo-ha!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going through and ripping the albums that I remember giving the &#8220;five-star&#8221; rating at some point in time.  I&#8217;m through De La Soul.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m convinced that I found the final piece of the puzzle to construct my on-line music database.  Now I can finally begin getting the pieces written.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, an excellent weekend.</p>
