<p>The project is undergoing its first customer demo as we speak.  It&#8217;s in Great Britian, which means I&#8217;m up at 4 in the morning!  I&#8217;m getting bored sitting here waiting for a problem, and I&#8217;m certainly not up for any taxing mental activity.</p>


	<p>As for what I&#8217;m working on these days, it&#8217;s an introduction to <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> using some techniques and tools from other popular open source projects.  It will also include a framework for unit testing a <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> application thoroughly.  It&#8217;s coming together pretty well, so far.  It appears that I may have to put it on the shelf for another week or so to handle some customer requests, but that&#8217;s the price we pay&#8230;</p>
