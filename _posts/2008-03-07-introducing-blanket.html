<p>I&#8217;d like to introduce you to <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/tree/master">Blanket</a>, a library designed to make automated, remote backup easier.  I&#8217;ve had to set up automated backup before, and I wrote this package to make it more enjoyable for myself and others.  I was also experimenting with a lot of new technologies and techniques, which makes it even more rewarding that the end product ending being a preliminary success.</p>


	<p>An <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/quickstart">introduction to Blanket</a> is available at the excellent <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/blanket/">blanket project on RubyForge</a> which means that I also have my first Gem in the wild.</p>


	<p>Install it, kick it around, and if you like what you see, take a look at <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet/blanket/wikis/todo">the development road map</a> and see if you&#8217;d like to get involved.  I have some GitHub invites if you need them, so please contact me if that&#8217;s an issue.</p>
