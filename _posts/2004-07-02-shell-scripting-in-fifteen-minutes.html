<p>I needed to automate a task for my Tomcat process.  Because I will probably never have time to track down how to actually log errors appropriately using log-rotaters and the like, I wanted to just use plain old crontab.  Having never really written a non-trivial shell script before, I found <a title="Writing shell scripts" href="http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/writing_shell_scripts.html#contents">this link</a> invaluable.  Enjoy!</p>
