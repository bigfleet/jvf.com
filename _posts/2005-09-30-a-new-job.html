<p>I&#8217;ve accepted an offer to work at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">Alterthought</a> in Richmond, VA about 300 yards from where I previously worked.  I&#8217;ll be working on Java web development, as usual.</p>


	<p>I was really excited to hear that they use the same major frameworks and <span class="caps">IDE</span> as I do (<a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">WebWork</a> , <a href="http://www.springframework.com/">Spring</a>, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>, and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> respectively.)  That means I should be able to jump right in and help, more or less.  I believe that Alterthought will be a great help to me in my personal growth, as well as enabling me to contribute back to the open-source community.</p>


	<p>More as it develops, dear readers!</p>
