<p>It turns out this machine is pretty neat.  It takes you about twenty seconds to get used to standing on it, and getting a feel for the body positions that generate the motions involved.  It also makes you realize that what <strong>you</strong> consider to be standing straight up might not be exactly accurate, center of gravity wise.</p>


	<p>So anyway, I avoided disaster.  I spun the thing around pretty well, for how much room the lady was giving me.  You turn it with a little control near your left hand, you lean forward and back to accelerate in that direction.  It can go decently fast, the pace of a brisk jog.  It can go 10-12 miles on a battery charge, and the tires are supposed to last several thousand miles.</p>


	<p>The bad part, as I see it, is where the hell are you supposed to use this thing?  If you&#8217;re a college student, I could see it.  But for that money?  If you&#8217;re in an urban environment, you could use it to get to work.  But only if you lived on the ground floor, and it wouldn&#8217;t get stolen at your place of work.</p>


	<p>I just don&#8217;t feel the early adopter spirit on this one.  Even if I could afford it, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be getting one.</p>


	<p>Now, those mail carriers out in Southwest Houston?  That&#8217;d be a different story.  I&#8217;d be all over that like white on rice.</p>
