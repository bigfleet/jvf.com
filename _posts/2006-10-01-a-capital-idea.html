<p>Megan and I returned this afternoon from a trip to DC to see <a href="http://www.massiveattack.co.uk/">Massive Attack</a> at the <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30 Club</a>.  My good friend Bill was able to come as well.  We were both pretty psyched that they were even playing in the general area, since they don&#8217;t tour stateside that often.  The show totally ruled.  No surprise there.</p>


	<p>It was even better than that, because of our stay at the <a href="http://www.hotelhelix.com/index.html">Hotel Helix</a> and our dinner at Duke&#8217;s Lounge.  Duke&#8217;s has an excellent Cosmopolitan, and we are planning big things for the Hotel Helix.  My sister absolutely has to see it.  It&#8217;s so incredibly her style I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>


	<p>There.  I finally posted about something more or less when it happened.  I still behind, but whatever.</p>
