<p><a href="http://statcvs.sourceforge.net/">StatCVS</a> reports that I&#8217;ve just recently cleared 10,000 lines of code.  A lot of those are in the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/">JFreeReport</a> code that I&#8217;ve just recently added, but I think they still count.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s a launch date of June 1, so I&#8217;ll get next week to do the straightening up and fixing a few known defects.  Then it&#8217;ll be off to the races!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m so fortunate at how this week has turned out.  One week ago today, it seemed like the project was already in the yellow and headed quickly towards the red.  I caught one last break, having good luck with laying out those reports myself.  So here we are!</p>


	<p>Be on the lookout in the near future for write-ups and notes of my future progress.  June should be a good month for learning!</p>
