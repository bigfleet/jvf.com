<p>It looks like I&#8217;ll be starting my own business as a result of this job.  The company is not withholding tax or social security or anything like that, so it looks like I&#8217;ll be forming a sole proprietorship to take advantage of some of the tax breaks.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve called a couple places around town, and they&#8217;ve just finished a CD which will walk me through the process step by step.  Do you guys have any ideas for a name?  And yes, this is a great chance for a joke at my expense.</p>
