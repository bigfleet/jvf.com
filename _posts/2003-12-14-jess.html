<p>I&#8217;d been thinking of things to say for months.  I was lucky enough to see him more in the past two months than I had in the past five or six years.  There were things like him getting out of the hospital and cooking me dinner that I thought would work its way into some kind of metaphor for how he treated his illness throughout his life, but it didn&#8217;t.  When it was time to speak at the viewing, all I could think about was my friend and everything we had been through, and I just couldn&#8217;t&#8230; say&#8230; anything&#8230;..</p>


	<p>We were a part of each other&#8217;s happy stories.  He sent me this wonderful e-mail reminding me of the ones he remembered, and I did the same for him.  It turns out that it was just after he had learned that the cancer was back.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m so tired of this.  Can&#8217;t this year end already?</p>
