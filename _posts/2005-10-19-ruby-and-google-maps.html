<p>I&#8217;ve finished a non-trivial <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> integration for one of my <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> apps.</p>


	<p>No offense, but the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/cartographer/">Cartographer</a> library has quite some way to go, but it was an excellent starting point.  I hope to be able to contribute some interesting functionality to it in the near-term future.</p>
