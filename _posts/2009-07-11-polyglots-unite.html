This was a great presentation by Foy Savas that was very engaging.  You'll want to see the tape if that ever circulates rather than reading any review.  That said, here it is.<!--more-->RPC sucks because it trips over itself.  PHP sucks because it did one thing well and then tried to do everything else, too.  Using the right tools should be paramount.  And if you're worried that the right tools are in different languages, continue to play around and trust your skills to come up with the right mixture.

Have no fear of the future!  Create it!  Being a Rubyist isn't about using Ruby like, all the time, OMG, it's about constant learning and seeking joy for yourself and your audience/client.
