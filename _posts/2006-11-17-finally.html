<p>The blog has found its next home.  The poor thing.  It might not be anywhere close to finished, either.  I&#8217;m not sure where it will be housed next.  I&#8217;m fairly certain that the next event will be a transformation into a <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> backed blog with a custom theme (although I may start with the one that I ported for <a href="http://www.cvreg.org"><span class="caps">CVREG</span></a>).  But one can never tell in this crazy world!</p>


	<p>I should be getting back into the lovely rhythm I had before the blog went down.  I&#8217;m getting a lot done while enjoying myself pretty consistently.  I&#8217;d love to be able to keep that up.</p>
