<p>Naked Objects is a <a href="http://www.nakedobjects.org/content.html"> thoroughly researched</a> assessment of the focus problems of our industry.  We deal with technical problems, day in and day out, so it&#8217;s easy to avoid the big, scary questions.  Naked Objects ask the question, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we just write the business objects and leave the rest to the user?&#8221;</p>


	<p>While I doubt that I&#8217;ll adopt the framework for projects in their entirety, I can easily see using the rapid prototyping capabilities.  How about whipping up something that actually worked between the first two days of a preliminary requirements meeting?  And then being able to keep that around to test the early stages of your persistence framework and interface?  I&#8217;ll keep you posted on any futher developments or use of the framework.</p>
