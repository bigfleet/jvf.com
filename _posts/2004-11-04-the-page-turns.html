<li><p>If you want to register at <a href="http://www.okcupid.com">OKCupid</a>, she&#8217;s petitebijou.  Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=9496595302755694323">link</a>, but it might not work.</p></li>
<li><p>She&#8217;s a very upbeat, very caring person.  She&#8217;s been very patient with my mild neuroses.  I&#8217;d say our relationship is best described by the word &#8220;comfortable.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>We haven&#8217;t been going out for very long.  I suppose that we would have started about a week after my last blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>I think we&#8217;re both pretty excited about having met each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way I can stay sane is to take it one day at a time, and let things go in their own direction at their own pace.  So far, no problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave a comment with tips for her on how to deal with me, if you like!  That&#8217;ll be funny&#8230;.</p></li>
