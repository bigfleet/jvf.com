<p>Nothing serious, but looking around the <span class="caps">OS X</span> realm, I happened upon <a title="vnunet.com NeXT Computer: when cool wasn't enough" href="http://www.vnunet.com/Features/1112630">a history of the NeXT computing platform</a>, and a <a href="http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/r/reality-distortion_field.html">term</a> coined about Steve Jobs.</p>


	<p>I got there from reading <a href="http://www.drunkenbatman.com/drunkenblog-archives/000257.html">this piece</a> which is about thirty things, linked from <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">/.</a>  Interesting ideas, and not a bad read.</p>
