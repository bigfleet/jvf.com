<p>The <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/bowlmania/frontpage">Sonic Bowl-Mania</a> challenge is one of those intriguing, faux-gambling type contests that intrigues me.  You can see my picks <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/bowlmania/entry?entryID=123049">here</a>.  I&#8217;m doing quite well, so far.</p>


	<p>Also, I&#8217;m in the fantasy super bowl in <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=leaguehome&#38;lid=486421">this league</a>!  I&#8217;m the Rice Owls.  Wish me luck this weekend!  If I&#8217;m victorious, it will be my first fantasy football title.  After writing myself off after a 1-2 start, I went on quite a streak down the stretch.</p>


	<p>Enjoy your sporting holidays!</p>
