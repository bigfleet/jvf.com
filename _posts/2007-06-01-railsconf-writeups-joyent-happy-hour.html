<p>Wow, this party was awesome!  I went for the first two days.  The second day gets its own entry, because me and Jon Maddox were some of the last people there.  We shut the party down!</p>


	<p>The most exciting thing that happened for me during the entire conference was on the balcony at the Doubletree when Chris Wanstrath (from <a href="http://errtheblog.com/">err the blog</a>) pulled out his business card.  On the back it says &#8220;Mite!&#8221; and I loudly proclaimed that his partner P.J. must have &#8220;Dyno&#8221; on the back of his.  I was, of course, correct.  Maybe next year (crosses fingers) I&#8217;ll actually collect them to prove it.</p>


	<p>Basically, the best part about the Joyent party was that it was a lively exchange about a lot of different things, from the poverty/hockey relationship in Detroit with <a href="http://anodyne.ca/">Grant McInnes</a>, a talk about <span class="caps">SXSW</span> with a guy who used to dislike it but now works for them, running into Gianni Jacklone who has a <a href="http://spherule.com/media/video/switch/gianni_jacklone.mov">switch to <span class="caps">OS X</span> commercial</a>, and the list goes on.</p>


	<p>The specifically Joyent part was also nice.  I had a brief but enjoyable chat with David.  I heard Jason talking to other Joyent staffers about things he probably wouldn&#8217;t want repeated.  Kristie told me that she loves me, presumably for starting <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=15643">this thread</a>  and gave me a hug.  She also gave me the advice to bring the Cubs hat, which isn&#8217;t a bad idea to help people recognize me.  I met Ryan Schwartz and Mark Mayo, on top of the Scotts that I had met the day before.</p>


	<p>When we got there, we saw something like <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jbaty/504974512/">this</a> and when we were done, it looked like <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/spurton/507223215/">this</a>.</p>
