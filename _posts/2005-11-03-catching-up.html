<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since the last substantive post, so I&#8217;ll just dump as I can while I wait for Mom to get into the neighborhood for dinner.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.cisv.org/"><span class="caps">CISV</span></a> board meeting went well.  I got the different work plans for my committee put together, and even a sniff from Venkat out in San Fran who wants to collaborate on a Rails project for the member database.  If he thinks I&#8217;m going to let him slip past on that, he&#8217;s crazy&#8230;</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Probably the best part of the <span class="caps">NBM</span> was the quality time I got to spend with my Dad.  He&#8217;s in a funny state of mind after having his position eliminated at Capital One, but we talked about the world of possibilities out there, and how good his situation is&#8212;you know, relatively.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>My mom&#8217;s grant proposal went through, so I&#8217;ll be project manager on a Rails project that I&#8217;ll only be peripherally involved with.  That&#8217;ll be a plus.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>In my own Rails work, I&#8217;m just continually impressed with the depth of the framework.  I&#8217;ve been working with it for a few months now, and I just got around to functional testing.  Not only is it a piece of cake, but it also tests <strong>rendering the page itself</strong> for you!  In essence, if you mess up something in your .rhtml file, your functional test will find that and bomb out.  Talk about minimizing surprises!</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I was also impressed with how easy it was to throw in a mock object.  One piece of my code goes out to the Internet to fetch data, for which I had already amassed a large amount of offline example data.  A few lines of code and a few <strong>require</strong> statements means I can run those tests using the files I&#8217;ve already downloaded to my hard drive.  I still miss Hibernate, but Ruby and Rails sure have some tricks up their sleeves.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The new job is going well, and I would say that even if I didn&#8217;t know that one of my three readers works there, too.  (Hi, <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com">Ryan</a>!)  I had to abandon the dream of Linux on the desktop which Ryan will now excoriate me for in the comments.  I am just going to have to fool around with that on my own.  I&#8217;m back on Windows and will be ready to start kicking butt tomorrow.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve been feeling under the weather recently, but I&#8217;m trying to stay up above it.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.richmondring.com">Richmond <span class="caps">RING</span></a> had it&#8217;s first Cashflow game on Tuesday evening.  The game was over in less than an hour&#8212;the most extraordinary performance I&#8217;ve seen yet.  It was a smash hit with the group, so that will turn into a regular engagement.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The album review will return this week.  Maybe I should just cut the crap and make it understood that I&#8217;ll have one out every two weeks.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I finished <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,403,zxmifm,trigun.html">Trigun</a> last night&#8212;after converting all my downloads to <span class="caps">MPEG2</span> and transferring them to my TiVo&#8212;and I would have preferred it to be a piece of crap right from the start.  That way, I would have felt satisfied that I hadn&#8217;t missed anything.  As is, the tone totally disagreed with me, there are not nearly enough <em>Ninja Scroll</em> type moments with the Gung Ho Guns.  The main character makes Hilary Clinton look like Newt Gingrich (or Mother Teresa look like Christopher Hitchens?).  Anyway, I give the thing a straight C.  Watch something else.</li>
