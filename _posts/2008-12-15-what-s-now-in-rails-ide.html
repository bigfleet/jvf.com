		<p>What does your environment look like these days?  Still using TextMate or have you moved on to something better?</p>

	<h2>There&#8217;s TextMate&#8230;</h2>


	<p>I still use TextMate.  It still has a lot to offer, and to me, it&#8217;s the most natural environment.  Here are the additional bundles that I have as a part of my installation.</p>


	<h3>GetBundles</h3>


	<p>Available from <span class="caps">SVN</span> <a href="http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/GetBundles.tmbundle/">here</a>, GetBundles is your one-stop shop for getting these bundles and more.  Check it out, absolutely.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://somethinglearned.com/articles/2008/06/03/ack-tmbundle-a-faster-find-in-project-for-textmate"><strong>Ack in TextMate</strong></a></h4>


	<p>(Also interesting is the <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/12/11/get-to-know-a-gem-rak">rak gem</a> for Ruby, if you are into the command line.)</p>


	<h4> <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2008/git-bundle/"><strong>Git</strong></a></h4>


	<p>Use this to help you use git while you get used to it.  The command line is so powerful, you&#8217;ll probably have to end up learning to use it there, but in the meantime, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have some simple things at your fingertips.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://github.com/drnic/github-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>GitHub</strong></a></h4>


	<p>This is basically just a glorified <code>blame</code> right now, but I anticipate that I will be able to use it to quickly load and comment publicly on certain commits.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>rSpec</strong></a> and <a href="http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle/tree/master"><strong>Cucumber</strong></a></h4>


	<p>These are my friends for testing.  I&#8217;ll be using that material for a talk (or lengthier blog post) soon.</p>


	<h2>and everything else.</h2>


	<p>There are a lot of people trying out things like emacs and vim again.  What&#8217;s old is new again!  If either of these are your favorite editor, I&#8217;m sure you can poke around and find some good resources.</p>
