<p>There&#8217;s been no music reviews.  For those that know me, you&#8217;re probably wondering what the hell that&#8217;s all about.  The answer is this:  I&#8217;m learning how to make it one of the cornerstones of my personal site.  This job is going to be the final piece for me.  Once I get a certain portion of it done, I&#8217;ll be able to whip some applications out almost on a whim.  It stands on the brink of completion.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I put in a big order for new rekkids at <a href="http://www.sandbox-automatic.com/">Sandbox </a> which is the source for good, underground hip-hop.  I promise to finally share some reviews, even if the big framework isn&#8217;t in place yet.</p>
