<p>Normally this would be a linkroll post.  (Are you reading the linkroll?  Megan is!)  In this case, however, I&#8217;m going to make an exception.</p>


	<p>Did you know that the United States <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/01/chinas_reserve_.html">requires 2 billion dollars a day in foreign investment</a>  to continue its current rate of capital consumption.  And that, for some reason, it&#8217;s creditors are willing to put up with a relatively low interest rate <strong>and</strong> devaluation of the dollar on top?</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t read all the economics blogs, but I can tell you, not even they know what this means.</p>


	<p>What I will say is that if you are typically inspired by the behavior of the US, go get that stove on credit!</p>
