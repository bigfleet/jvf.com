<p>So, I took a few pictures of the various sections a few weeks ago, and now it&#8217;s up on the web.</p>


	<p>View <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/projects/garden">Jim and Megan&#8217;s garden</a>!</p>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t go the flickr route except with a couple of them.  And I have a problem spending $30 on something that my linux tools do at least a decent job of automating.</p>


	<p>I also don&#8217;t have any captions on any of them, because, to be quite honest, I know the names of about a half-dozen of the plants.  I know Megan knows more.  Anyway, I talked a little bit about why <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/09/17/plants">I love the garden so much</a> already, and I need to get rolling today.</p>
