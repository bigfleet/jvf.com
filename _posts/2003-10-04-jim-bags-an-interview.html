<p>I have an interview for a webmaster position Monday morning with Capital One.  I feel very qualified, and I know from my Dad that it&#8217;s a great place to work.  I&#8217;ve been nothing but impressed with Richmond so that would be another positive.  I, of course, will let you guys know how it goes as I do.</p>
