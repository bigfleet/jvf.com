<p>It has been an absolutely batty six weeks.</p>


	<p>You already saw all about my trip to RailsConf.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been engaged in a lot of communication with the executive team at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERthought</a>, which is where I work.  Those communications have gone in a lot of different directions, but there have been a number of good outcomes.  I feel that I am contributing more to the organization in new ways that help me grow as a professional.  I&#8217;m cutting my teeth on preparing and presenting large-scale, long-term service engagements which is new to me.  That&#8217;s in addition to making sure that ALTERthought remains a premier supporter of Ruby on Rails in the Southeast.  Exciting stuff!</p>


	<p>And that&#8217;s in addition to actually performing my first billable work in a long time, and the first time I&#8217;ve worked for a client on site at my job.  I still haven&#8217;t left the Vantage Place parking lot since December of 2005 for my day job, though.  How bizarre.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.meganandjimswedding.com/">The wedding</a> approaches.  The invitations are set to go out on Monday.  There is a lot left to do, but Megan seems happy about taking it all on, at least.  We talked last night about how awesome the entire event is going to be.  I really hope that a lot of my friends scattered throughout the country will decide to come, although I know it can be expensive.</p>


	<p>My fantasy baseball team took the biggest toilet dive that I&#8217;ve ever managed.  A combination of injuries, bad drafting, and bad strategy are to blame.  Rice failed to make it to the title series in the College World Series for the second year in a row after beginning 2-0 in bracket play.  Not encouraging sports news, perhaps I&#8217;m earning karma for football season.</p>


	<p>Megan ended her school year successfully and is now weighing her options for employment.  Our financial advisor paid her a very nice compliment by indicating that he would like to see her working alongside him at New York Life.  There is a lot to respect about that company and that profession;  I also know that Megan would do a great job.</p>


	<p>Jeremy, Tasha, Bill, Rob, and Kate are all doing well, and I&#8217;m excited to have a close group of friends in town.</p>
