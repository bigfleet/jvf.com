<p>I haven&#8217;t started reading his books because of his death, but I read <em>Cat&#8217;s Cradle</em> during my sister&#8217;s graduation.  I fell in love all over again with his content and his style.  I hadn&#8217;t read any of his work since I was in middle school (Harrison Bergeron, with the predictable effects).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve read the first few pages of <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>, and I am quite certain that he will become one of my favorite authors.  At the same time, it becomes clear to me that I should begin some library transfer from my father.</p>
