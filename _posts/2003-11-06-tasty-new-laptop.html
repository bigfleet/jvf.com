<p>I&#8217;m getting a new laptop!  Once again, it&#8217;s not technically mine, it&#8217;s being bought by <span class="caps">OPGI</span>.  The next computer I buy for personal use will be an Apple, I vow.  This one would have been an Apple as well, but it appears that one of the tools I&#8217;d like to use for my web application development project will only work on PC.  It&#8217;s written in Java, so one would expect it would work anywhere, but not a lot of people are supporting the tool, and&#8212;really&#8212;what can you do?</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a Dell Latitude 800, and I&#8217;ll love it as if it were my own.  I&#8217;m only checking to see if it&#8217;s finally been boxed every half hour.  Torturous!</p>
