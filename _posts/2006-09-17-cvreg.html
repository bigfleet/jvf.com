<p>The <a href="http://www.cvreg.org/">Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts&#8217; Group</a> is up and running!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve certainly been part of many non-profit groups, but I have never really started one.  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to see how this all turns out.  We&#8217;ve got a great group of people already coming to the meeting, and we just recently got our website up with more details.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re reading my blog for that sort of thing, go check it out!  There may be some interesting content there for you eventually.</p>
