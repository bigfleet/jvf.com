<p>Yesterday, I had a good meeting with a local real estate investor group.  Real estate investment is something I heard about first from Rich Dad, Poor Dad which is a book I&#8217;ll have a review up for shortly.  At any rate, for various reasons including late-night infomercials, the real estate market is hot.  I&#8217;ve been following the scene for awhile, and there is absolutely no good software to support the mind-numbing amount of detail that active investors have to keep up with.  As writing software happens to be a talent of mine, I see this as an opportunity to learn the business and create a potentially hit product all at once.</p>


	<p>I filed as an <span class="caps">LLC</span> last week and should get my registration sometime this week.  I have purchased domain names.  In another two weeks or so, I should have a usable product that&#8217;s small in scope.  &#8220;It&#8217;ll be better, not beta&#8221; is the rallying cry of <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">37 Signals</a> and the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> folks, and one that I think is suitable.  (The Rails community is where I&#8217;m focusing my spare mental energy on the technical side these days.)</p>


	<p>So, that is pretty much my first play to make a bunch of money.  I&#8217;ll let you guys now how it&#8217;s going.</p>
