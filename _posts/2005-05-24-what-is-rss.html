<p>Well, I&#8217;m not going to tell you yet, but <a title="feedication.com - bigfleet - flickr" href="http://feedication.com/bigfleet/flickr">here is a collection of some of the sites I visit around the web.</a>  A neat place to get information about me periodically, as even if I don&#8217;t post here, I&#8217;ll be doing something with <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.</p>


	<p>Gosh, I&#8217;ve got a lot to get out and on here.  <em>(sigh)</em></p>
