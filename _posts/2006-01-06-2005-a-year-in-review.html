<p>2005 was a really big year, and if 2006 is anything like it, my 27th year on earth will see quite a lot.</p>


	<h3>Geek Stuff</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m a gigantic nerd, so it&#8217;s not too much of a surprise that this section is pretty busy.  I
<a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/01/18/whoa">got my first #1 ranking</a> on Google, even though the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hyades+tomcat">current search</a> yields no love.
I started to <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/01/24/geek-cred">really work with open-source operating systems</a>, a trend which continues to the current day.  I&#8217;m posting this from Ubuntu, which I hope to write about soon.  (OK, I&#8217;m not&#8212;but I could have been.)
I drank the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/02/22/i-am-so-sold">Ruby On Rails</a> koolaid, even though I don&#8217;t really see my opinions on it represented on the blogosphere.  I know that because I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/12/an-example">entered it</a> during 2005.</p>


	<p>I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/03/trac-and-txd">anted up</a> for a lifetime of shared hosting at TextDrive.  I should reach break-even next year at some point.  I made that move, in part, to <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/04/what-took-you-so-long">move to a new blogging platform</a>.
And even though it&#8217;s probably of more personal interest, I&#8217;ll include <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/30/a-new-job">getting my new job</a> under this section.</p>


	<h3>Personal Milestone</h3>


	<p>Beyond the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/09/30/a-new-job">new job</a>, there was the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/11/raise-high-the-roof-beam-carpenters">new house</a> with its ridiculous <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/03/its-official-redux">listing</a>.  There were many trials and tribulations; so many, in fact, that I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/pages/my-first-house">stopped writing about them in the middle</a>, although the concerns are minor in the grand scheme of things.  I couldn&#8217;t be happier with my house, even through all the little nits and picks.  For those of you interested in buying a house, I highly recommend it, especially if there&#8217;s an <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/06/16/weekly-update"><span class="caps">IKEA</span> nearby to fleece</a>.  Just be prepared for <strong>a lot</strong> of the unexpected.</p>


	<p>While buying the house was not a direct outgrowth of <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/03/09/wheres-my-beer">my desire to increase my financial literacy</a>, my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/25/all-about-the-benjamins">exploration of the real estate market</a> certainly was.  So was <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/25/its-official">starting my first business</a>.</p>


	<p>Also, I celebrated my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/10/19/megan-and-me">first anniversary of dating Megan</a>  with a wonderful <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/11/25/happy-holidays">Thanksgiving</a> and <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/01/01/happy-new-year">Christmas season</a>.</p>


	<h3>And, Finally&#8230;</h3>


	<p>I <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2005/05/13/my-friend-flickr">got a digital camera</a>.  Hooray!</p>
