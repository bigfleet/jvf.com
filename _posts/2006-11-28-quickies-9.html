<ul>
	<li>Megan and I redid the kitchen!  It&#8217;s mostly her doing, although I did a lot of the furniture assembly.  We repainted and redecorated.  In somewhat related news, is there some place like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> that&#8217;s actually free?</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I thought the holidays went really well, although I personally was sick for most of Thanksgiving day and parts of the surrounding days.  I am mostly over it now, but not completely.  Yuck.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I was effectively eliminated from playoff contention in my one fantasy football league.  That&#8217;s tough to take, because I feel like the top three teams are all in my division, and I just didn&#8217;t get the breaks this year.  If I find myself in a football league half as enjoyable as the <a href="http://fans.pbwiki.com/">Fans of the <span class="caps">ACC</span></a> fantasy baseball league that I am in&#8212;that&#8217;ll be a happy day.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>That fact has in no way damaged my enjoyment of this college football season, which is the most enjoyable in my memory&#8212;besides Tennessee&#8217;s 1997 championship, of course.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I think <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.org">Jeremy</a> and I are really getting into some fruitful discussion areas.  Changing minds, both your own and others, is tough!</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Thanks to <a href="http://itlu.ownz.ch/wordpress/">this software</a>, my iPod and I are finally getting along somewhat.  I want to like it, I do, it&#8217;s a great piece of hardware but I much preferred loading up my iRiver&#8212;it just did what I wanted.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve been getting more exposure to <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a> at work since we&#8217;re transitioning to a hosted service for our e-mail.  That is one slick program!  I&#8217;m excited that I might actually be able to use a calendar.  Neither Google&#8217;s nor Yahoo!&#8217;s ever stuck for me.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m going to see if my sister can turn out a design for my redesign.  Then, even if that works, I&#8217;ll have to do the <span class="caps">CSS</span> part.  Here&#8217;s hoping!  After that, I&#8217;ll still have to do some work to get the categories into <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> ready shape.  But I&#8217;m excited and ready to make the switch.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>As far as <span class="caps">CISV</span> goes, a new web design is in store there, and I think it&#8217;s really good.  That&#8217;ll be a fun week to move <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/">the <span class="caps">CISV USA</span></a> site to something from the 21st century.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I heard <a href="http://money.cnn.com/blogs/legalpad/index.html?cnn=yes">she</a> started with <a href="http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/">one red paperclip</a>.</li>
	</ul>
