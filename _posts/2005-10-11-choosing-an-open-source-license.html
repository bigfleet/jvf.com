<p>I&#8217;ve recently completed enough work on jsCalcLib to feel like it&#8217;s good enough to release for public consumption.  Perfect?  No.  Good enough?  Absolutely.  Wish I wouldn&#8217;t have had to write it in the first place, anyway.</p>


	<p>So, now I&#8217;m in the position of selecting an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.php">open-source license</a> for the code.  I guess that the <span class="caps">LGPL</span> is the clubhouse leader, but I will enjoy looking over the alternatives.</p>


	<p>Look for more information soon on a new SourceForge project!</p>
