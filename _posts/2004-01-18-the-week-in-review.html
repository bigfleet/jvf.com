<p>I&#8217;m so sleepy.</p>


	<p>It wasn&#8217;t as good of a week.  I&#8217;ll be glad when the first consulting gig is over, so I can roll off those kind of projects for awhile.  There&#8217;s some stops closer to the computing base camp I need to cover first.</p>


	<p>I got to the gym four days out of five.  I got by in touch with Elizabeth, my one VA friend.  Pretty much a grinding week, hope to have more fun next time.</p>
