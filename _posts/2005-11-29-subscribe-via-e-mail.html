<p>I&#8217;ve added a new feature to the site, via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> and <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com">FeedBlitz</a>.  You can now subscribe to this blog via e-mail, meaning that you&#8217;ll receive a notification every time I post a new entry.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d prefer that you went the <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/pages/about-rss"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> route, but I understand if you don&#8217;t want to complicate things.  Anyway, you now have the option.  If you try it, comment here to let me know how it works.</p>
