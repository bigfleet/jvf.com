<p>Not Safari, the excellent <span class="caps">OS X</span> web browser, but the <a title="O'Reilly Network Safari Bookshelf" href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly Network Safari Bookshelf</a>.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s really a <a href="http://www.netflix.com">NetFlix</a> for the computer development world, only the content is fully searchable and available online.  I&#8217;m currently using my free preview, and it&#8217;s so affordable, I really can&#8217;t imagine any professional developer wanting to do without it.</p>


	<p>Kudos to Cobbie Behren, who was nice enough to respond to a comment I made on <a href="http://www.cobbie.com/blog">his blog</a> by beginning a very useful conversation!  Thanks Cobbie!</p>
