<p>One of the things that I loathe about learning is the first step on the learning curve.  You go to the <a href="http://xdoclet.sf.net">XDoclet</a> site, and it seems like there are a zillion bits of information whizzing around in a thousand places.  How do you pick the one place to start?</p>

<p>I personally do not have the ability to start in more than one place.  Reap the benefits of my simple XDoclet + Hibernate Ant task.  Feel free to post a comment with any questions, but it should feel largely self documented.</p>
