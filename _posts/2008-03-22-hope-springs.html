<p>As I write this, with the late evening games of Round 1 yet to conclude, I stand tied for first in <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/group?entryIDFrom=2430688&#38;groupID=16115">my bracket competition</a>.  Come on, buckets, I could use the spare dough!  I am officially worried by the Clemson Tigers at this second, however.  A Tiger beats a Wildcat every time, though, so I am sure they&#8217;ll pull through.  I don&#8217;t care how feisty that Wildcat is.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m happy to see the UT men&#8217;s basketball team put together a good season, and I thought the game against Memphis was a classic.  I hope to see them do well, even though I picked them to get upset early.  That way I at least get something to be happy about either way.</p>


	<p>The <a href="http://fans.pbwiki.com/">Fans of the <span class="caps">ACC</span></a> 2008 season is about to get underway.  It seems that there&#8217;s always something rocky during the off-season, and I&#8217;m considering having this be my last year as commissioner so that I can just enjoy playing for a change, but who knows.</p>


	<p>I like the way my team looks&#8212;but I did last year as well and finished 8th out of ten!  I drafted horribly and made some terrible trades.  I tried to learn from my mistakes and put together a better off-season this time.  You can check out <a href="http://fansoftheacc.baseball.sportsline.com/teams/page/1">my team</a> if you like.</p>


	<p>I may not have football, but it&#8217;s a good looking spring right now.</p>
