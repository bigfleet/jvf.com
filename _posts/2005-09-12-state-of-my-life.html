<h3>Richmond <span class="caps">RING</span></h3>


	<p>I am the membership chairman for the <a href="http://www.richmondring.com/">Richmond Real Estate Investors Networking Group</a>.  It&#8217;s a group that has a handful of experienced real-estate investors, willing to share their knowledge.  I&#8217;ve already learned a lot from the group, and I hope it continues to thrive despite the poor showings from the last two months.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m preparing an application to help me manage the membership details.  I&#8217;m using Ruby on Rails and <span class="caps">AJAX</span> to help me keep up with incoming flow of people as they walk in the door.  This application I can later expand to be useful for <span class="caps">CISV</span>, as well.</p>


	<h3> Online Creative Real Estate Center</h3>


	<p>I am the sole member of Online Creative Real Estate Center, <span class="caps">LLC</span>.  I am preparing this application for use within an advanced real estate investing group here in Richmond.  It is my first real serious Rails application, and it has required serious work.  I have gotten Trac and Subversion working at <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a> and that&#8217;s really helped me stay organized, as I only get to focus on that application from time to time.</p>


	<p>I am also learning the ropes of actually being an investor from these fellows.  I may soon be attempting to contact those with delinquent income tax in my county and seeing if they&#8217;d like to sell me their house on the cheap.  With help from <a href="http://www.anyhouseanywhere.com/"><span class="caps">AAA</span> Investors</a>, I can make some money if someone says yes.</p>


	<h3> The House</h3>


	<p>The new house is looking great.  I really like the color scheme that we&#8217;ve ended up with, and you can judge for yourself by viewing my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigfleet/sets/866483/">house photos on flickr</a></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s still quite a lot of work to do.  We will be focusing on the house landscaping soon, and trying to finish up all the elements on the inside.  We&#8217;ve been working on getting the bushes and trees trimmed up this last week.</p>


	<h3> The Blog</h3>


	<p>The blog is obviously righting itself.  You can keep track of my progress in the lower right corner, where I let you know what changes might be in store.</p>


	<h3> Football</h3>


	<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for this college football season to get interesting, with almost every team in the top 10 either losing or having a close call.</p>


	<p>My fantasy teams seem to be performing pretty well.  Of course, we&#8217;re almost done with the afternoon games, so there&#8217;s still plenty of football left.</p>
