<p><a title="Object-relation mapping without the container" href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-hibern/?ca=dnt-515">Object-relation mapping without the container</a> is an article talking about integrating <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>, the <a href="http://www.service-architecture.com/object-relational-mapping/articles/index.html">O/R mapping</a> tool that I&#8217;m using, with <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>.    I&#8217;m not entirely sure what you would call Spring, at this point.  It seems to be called a &#8220;container,&#8221; but I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s not in the vein of Tomcat.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll do a little research on this after I clean up my room.</p>
