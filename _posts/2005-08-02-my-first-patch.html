<p>My first patch to an open source project is to WebWork for the <a title="[#WW-813] Make ExecuteAndWaitInterceptor easier to extend - OpenSymphony JIRA" href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/WW-813">execute and wait interceptor.</a></p>


	<p>Raise your hands if you had that in the office pool.</p>


	<p>If/when the patch is accepted, I&#8217;ll post my extension to the interceptor that will keep an open Hibernate session bound to the background process using Spring.</p>
