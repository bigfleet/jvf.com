<p>That&#8217;s right, time for a spate of updates.  This one will be fun!</p>


<ul>
<li>My last entry titles have used entirely too many exclamation points</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to go see Bright Eyes this weekend</li>
<li>Me and <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=9496595302755694323">Megan</a> are still going out.  It&#8217;s going quite well.  You&#8217;ll have to contact me personally for all the lurid details.  <em>Did I say lurid?</em></li>
<li>Brady bought a house</li>
<li>Allie got engaged, and I am such a bad friend, I haven&#8217;t even called her yet to congratulate her, although that is on the schedule for this weekend.</li>
<li>So is calling Andy, who I haven&#8217;t talked to in probably a year and a half.</li>
<li>Eric Furbish is coming to town at the end of February.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to Tennessee in the middle of February.</li>
<li>I turn 26 in, like, 16 days</li>
<li>I got called in by Robert Half Technology to bail some project out.  It&#8217;s at once flattering and kind of scary.  I&#8217;m going to do this one because I feel great right now, and it&#8217;s always nice to have a couple more tech folks that you know when you&#8217;re in my line of work.  But rescuing troubled projects sounds like a way to get an ulcer in about five years.  There&#8217;s <strong>so many</strong> ways to get yourself into trouble on a tech project.  And, as I&#8217;ll write an essay about shortly, there&#8217;s no <em>inherent</em> incentive to produce good projects.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m working on some other big projects, but I&#8217;m only going to mention them here when there&#8217;s something to actually discuss.  Right now, it&#8217;s too unreal.</li>
<li>I really like my new job.  The work has been very gratifying.  I like the people.  The laptop that they issued me is unbelievable.</li>
<li>I am totally rocking the Palm Tungsten C again.  I forgot how nice it was to have it with me at all times.  Thanks to Megan&#8217;s messenger bag (which I am not allowed to call a <em>man-purse</em>) I can do that no matter what I&#8217;m wearing.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Isn&#8217;t that enough?</p>
