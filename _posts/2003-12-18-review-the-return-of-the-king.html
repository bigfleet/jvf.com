<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into detail here, as much of the magic of the book is in the plot, and it&#8217;s hard to talk about what I liked and didn&#8217;t like without giving it away.   In short, the movie rules, it&#8217;s the best one of the series.  If you haven&#8217;t watched any of the series, do yourself a favor, rent the <span class="caps">DVD</span>&#8217;s over the next week then watch the finale on the big screen.  This is one of those movies that, unless you&#8217;ve shelled out for the serious home theater system, you&#8217;re going to feel slighted if you wait to rent it.</p>


	<p>The one thing I&#8217;ll say for those who have read the books: you might be concerned about how they handle the very ending, after the climax.  It&#8217;s done just OK.  It&#8217;s the only thing which gives the .3 deduction for a <strong>9.7/10</strong></p>
