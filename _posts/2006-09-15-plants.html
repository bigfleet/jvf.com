<p>While we were <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/09/17/stranger-in-a-familiar-land">on vacation</a>, our yard was magically transformed from one with builder&#8217;s grade holly bushes and juniper stumps to one with two full beds around the two main edges of the house, a new tree, and new beds under the existing tree and by our mailbox.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s been exciting for many reasons.</p>


	<p>First, I finally feel like the neighborhood has evidence that we care about how our house looks.  Those stumps have been out in the yard for about a year, and no matter if Megan prefers that to the alternative, it&#8217;s still tacky.</p>


	<p>Second, the plants themselves are very nice.  I felt like <a href="http://www.greenleafgardens/">Kathy</a> really listened to us and knew what we wanted.  That really showed up in the final results.</p>


	<p>Third, I&#8217;ve never really had such visible evidence of &#8220;Wow, I watered it and now it&#8217;s really growing!&#8221;  It&#8217;s a bonding experience, espcecially for such a techie like myself. We have some really excellent rose bushes!  They are <a href="http://www.knockoutroses.com/">a new kind of rose</a>, apparently, and they&#8217;ve already taken off.</p>


	<p>Finally, the watering and weeding (at this point) is very centering for me.  Spending a few minutes thinking of nothing besides covering some beds with water is very Zen like.  I&#8217;ve even done some weeding over the past couple of days&#8212;it&#8217;s so frustrating to see some stupid onion shoots in the middle of all those beautiful plants!</p>
