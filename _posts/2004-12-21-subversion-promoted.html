<p><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> has now cracked the starting line-up, replacing <span class="caps">CVS</span>.  The cygwin installation (along with the knowledge that Subversion is written to be a client and a server) is enough to get you set up with a local repository after following the simple instructions in the book.</p>


	<p>As a devoted <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> user, I found it useful to go to the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> update site at <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/update">http://subclipse.tigris.org/update</a> and use Eclipse&#8217;s update facility to install the book and Subclipse itself.</p>


	<p>From there, it was no problem at all to get set up!  When combined with the upcoming <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/svn/index.html">Subversion book</a> from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a>, it looks like Subversion has now earned its stripes.</p>
