<p>When I was taking my Human Factors course at Rice, I was the &#8220;tech rat&#8221; that produced a working application following a set of usability guidelines.  I&#8217;ve wanted to get my hands on those guidelines again ever since, and now, there&#8217;s the <a title="MIT IS&#38;T: Usability Guidelines" href="http://web.mit.edu/ist/usability/usability-guidelines.html"><span class="caps">MIT</span> IS&#38;T: Usability Guidelines</a> for reference.  This is even better than the one we had.</p>
