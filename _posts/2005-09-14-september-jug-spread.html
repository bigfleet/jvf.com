<p>I attended a <a href="http://www.novajug.com:8080/">NovaJug</a> meeting last night with <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a> talking about Domain Specific Languages and <a href="http://www.patrickpeak.com/page/patrick">Patrick Peak</a> who spoke about Hibernate.</p>


	<p>Domain Specific Languages seem like something I&#8217;ll keep my eye on, but are nowhere close to being used in real applications today. I&#8217;m intrigued by some of the possibilities, but if, as in our presentation, readability and clarity for the end user are the goals, then, honestly, I&#8217;m not sure if it will gain much traction. I might post my reasons why if I get the time, but let&#8217;s get serious, no one cares.</p>


	<p>Patrick&#8217;s talk was slightly more useful to me, since he was able to confirm that my worries with integrating <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/">XDoclet</a> with <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>.</p>


	<p>My main impression is still that I&#8217;m closer to being a speaker at one of these meetings than getting much out of them anymore. I was fortunate enough to start my Java career after <span class="caps">EJB</span>, I stay abreast of the blogosphere goings on, and most importantly, I use these frameworks myself. (Or at least evaluate them, usually.)</p>


	<p>I was sort of surprised to see that Patrick was caught up in an attack on Rails deployment. After meeting the fellow, I find it impossible to believe that he was out to attack Rails, and that you should believe him in his <a href="http://www.patrickpeak.com/page/patrick/20050715#the_vast_right_wing_java">follow-up post</a></p>
