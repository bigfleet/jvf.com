<p>Megan got me <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/">XM Radio</a> for my car and I&#8217;ve really been enjoying that.  It didn&#8217;t take long!  We also spotted a sale on the boom box unit at a going-out-of-business sale at a Sam Goody franchise, and that will be very useful for work around the house without having to pay for a second unit monthly.</p>


	<p>XM Radio is sort of like cable for your radio, for those who aren&#8217;t familiar with it.  I listened to a song called &#8220;Hank Williams, You Wrote My Life&#8221;, followed shortly by a song from Broken Social Scene.  (On another channel, of course.)</p>


	<p>My folks also got me a new oven, which is a lot less sexy, but also a lot more useful, when it all comes down to it.</p>


	<p>I haven&#8217;t really made any goals for the coming year.  I did that for year #26, but they didn&#8217;t really seem to match with what I thought was the right thing to do at the time.  I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s my goals or my attitude that need adjusting&#8230;</p>
