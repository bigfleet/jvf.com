<p><em>(Originally written on July 26)</em></p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to start with this one because I&#8217;ve been in a pretty crappy mood for the past 24 hours or so. I completely forgot about an important meeting yesterday, and <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/1663">mysterious bugs</a> in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> are keeping me from sharing my project with the team. Thus, like this album on the charts, I&#8217;m in a bit of a freefall. I&#8217;m sure Mark would find that only appropriate.</p>


	<p>There was a time some years ago when this album would easily have been in my top ten, if not number 1. Mark Eitzel was the first artist I really followed. After I discovered Mark, and his band, <a href="http://www.american-music-club.com/">American Music Club</a> (on an album to be named later here in this series), I joined the (apparently now defunct) Firefly mailing list in 1994. Firefly was the first real Internet community that I felt like I was a part of&#8212;as the youngest member. I bought all the Eitzel related records I could get my hands on. I made mix tapes for myself consisting entirely of their songs. I included a song from them on the mix tapes I made for other people. I listened to my favorite albums like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=jimvanfleetco-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B000003BTG">Songs of Love Live</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=jimvanfleetco-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B000002MIV">Mercury</a>, and Lovers Leap <span class="caps">USA</span> (which was <em>stolen</em> from me) over and over again. But the jazzy tones on this record and the overall grey feeling made an indelible impression, and that&#8217;s what lands <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=jimvanfleetco-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B000002N4P">60 Watt Silver Lining</a> on the top of the <span class="caps">AMC</span>/Eitzel stack.</p>


	<p>Unfortunately for this record&#8217;s overall ranking, it was on the player during a part of my life I don&#8217;t recall that fondly. My freshman year of college was a real downer. Compared to the rest of my college life where I was either partying or dealing with the consequences of partying, I really didn&#8217;t do anything my freshman year except piss off my friends back home and play <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo2/">Diablo</a>. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, though, Diablo is a great game.</p>


	<p>It does make me wonder: do depressing albums like this face a disadvantage when facing the inevitable ranking? Wouldn&#8217;t anyone, regardless of their disposition, prefer happy feelings to sad ones?</p>
