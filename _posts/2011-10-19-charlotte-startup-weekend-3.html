<p>I haven't blogged since the last Startup Weekend in Charlotte!  Must mean it's time for another one, as the next Startup Weekend approaches.</p>
	<p>First is <a href="http://charlotte.startupweekend.org/">Charlotte Startup Weekend 3</a>, where I am a co-organizer.  You can read our <a href="http://charlotte.startupweekend.org/2011/10/13/announcing-charlotte-startup-weekend-3/">kickoff blog for <span class="caps">CSW3</span></a> on our site.  We also have testimonials from <a href="http://charlotte.startupweekend.org/2011/10/18/technologists-love-charlotte-startup-weekend/">technologists</a> and <a href="http://charlotte.startupweekend.org/2011/10/18/tagseats-a-special-charlotte-startup-weekend-testimonial/">business people</a>.  This is a great event for working on a project for the fun of it, and making friends and connections in the Charlotte startup community at the same time.</p>

	<p>It’s November 4-6, so it’s in a few weeks.  We have a lot of sponsors, judges, advisors and volunteers to introduce, but we need attendees!  If you cannot afford the registration fees, please contact me, as there may be some scholarship possibilities.</p>

	<p>If you’re not sure whether Startup Weekend is right for you, there’s an event from Collaborate <span class="caps">CLT</span> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Startups/Charlotte-NC/428152/">CLT Launch</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Packard-Place-Innovation-Entrepreneurship-Community-Group/events/37957682/">Packard Place</a> to help you evaluate that on Tuesday, October 25.</p>

	<p>Finally, if you are interested in the Charlotte startup community, I publish a newsletter that attempts to circulate great information about what’s happening and who is involved here in the city.  You can view the <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=8b4656bd4a093a3bcabfda08a&amp;id=564f168838">archives</a>  or <a href="http://eepurl.com/e0AO6">sign up</a>!</p>

	<p>Thanks for your time and attention.</p>
