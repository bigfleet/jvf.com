<li>I really don&#8217;t care about the syntax.  If I need to use the functionality, I&#8217;ll learn how to use it the way it&#8217;s been written.  It&#8217;s just part of the cost to me in the developer&#8217;s seat.  Nobody is <strong>forcing</strong> you to use it;  we&#8217;re ages away from when there will be a legacy system using it.</li>
<li>I thought that it was going to provide something similar to <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/">XDoclet</a> .  To be fair, I also don&#8217;t understand XDoclet that well, but I have seen how it&#8217;s used with Hibernate.  It seems to be that <span class="caps">JSR</span>-175 is aiming in a slightly different direction, such that you could use one or the other, or use them both together</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really excited about what might be done with these annotations, and it&#8217;s an excellent idea to be aware of.  I especially agree that the fit with <a href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=AOP&#38;action=Search"><span class="caps">AOP</span></a> is exciting.  Java computing could look quite a bit different in five years.  Sun:  keeping the educators in business.</li>
<li>In terms of my plans, I&#8217;m definitely wait and see on this one.  I&#8217;m much more willing to get my hands dirty with generics, since I&#8217;ve got much more training in that area, and the benefits are immediate and easy to understand.</li>
