<p>In a piece he calls <a title="PragDave" href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/ValueWorker.rdoc">The End of the Knowledge Worker?</a>, Dave Thomas talks about about what it&#8217;s like for a programmer to progress through their professional life, and what the greater meaning in that process for the industry.</p>


	<p>I think it&#8217;s quite insightful, and I also think it&#8217;s clear that it means the &#8220;unskilled&#8221; programmers will be the first to be outsourced.  Isn&#8217;t this what we want?  Does the world need another poorly written app?</p>
