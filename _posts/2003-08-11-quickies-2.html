<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Jim joins the 21st century</strong></font></dt>
<dd>There&#8217;s a cell phone with my name on it in Virginia with the folks.  This&#8217;ll be a first for me, not counting the two weeks I had Erin&#8217;s cell phone.  At least I&#8217;ve finally established a history of not losing important electronic items!</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>I went on a &#8220;date.&#8221;</strong></font></dt>
<dd>It wasn&#8217;t the first one.  I&#8217;ve met both girls on the Internet, as I really don&#8217;t feel the internal strength to go out and give it a try.  It&#8217;s not that I care about getting hurt, it&#8217;s just exhausting and I&#8217;m already tired.  By the way, both girls apparently just decided to not reply to some communication from me.  Is this <i>en vogue</i> now?  I see why it pisses women off so much.  I could care less if they just didn&#8217;t think there wasn&#8217;t any chemistry.  Because they&#8217;re right, there hasn&#8217;t been any.  But as it is, it still pops up in my brain every now and again.  Annoying.</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Moving appointment</strong></font></dt>
<dd>The movers are coming to give me a quote Wednesday morning.  I&#8217;m sick of Houston.  I&#8217;m in a pattern here that I need help to get myself out of, and moving should be just the ticket.  Living with somebody responsible helps you get in good habits.  I can start them, no problem, but I need help to keep them going.</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Vacation coming</strong></font></dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m headed to Virginia Beach next week!  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to get to the beach.  Hopefully that week will be all I need to get the Seba project completed, and I&#8217;m could probably finish at least two books.  I&#8217;ve got 100 pages or so left on two different ones.  It&#8217;s been so long since I took three books on a beach trip!  Just thinking about the ocean relaxes me.</dd>
