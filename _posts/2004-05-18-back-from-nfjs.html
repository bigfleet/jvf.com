<p>I&#8217;ll be processing the notes, and sharing the results here, as time goes on.  For now, I&#8217;ll give the recollections I have.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave">Dave Thomas</a> is a great speaker.  Cobbie told me to go see all of his talks, and I should have paid attention.  The one I did attend, Pragmatic Mock Objects, gave me a tool that will soon become a cornerstone of my entire testing framework.</li>
<li>Stu Halloway at <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/">Relevance, <span class="caps">LLC</span></a> is very effective as a speaker, and had some great advanced programming techniques.  You can take a look at them <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/halloway/P_MetaProgramming.html">here</a> or download his book <a href="http://www.develop.com/us/technology/developmentorseriesdownload.aspx?id=11">here</a></li>
<li>Bruce Tate of <a href="http://www.j2life.com/">J2Life</a> and Rick Hightower of <a href="http://www.arc-mind.com/">ArcMind</a> both gave very interesting talks.  I got quite a bit out of the more in-depth introduction to <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>, which they both like, and the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/writeUps/TestDrivenDevelopment"><span class="caps">TDD</span></a> for the Web session that Rick did.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hotwire.com/">Hotwire</a> worked great for me; consider it recommended</li></ul>
