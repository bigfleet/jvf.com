<h2>Important Hardware</h2>


	<p>The iPod is no longer just a geek device.  TiVo never was.  (Good luck, <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> fanatics!)  These hardware makers would, of course, love to avoid having to license <span class="caps">MP3</span>, but each has their own reasons they&#8217;re strongly disincented to even try.  Apple has its own <span class="caps">AAC</span> format with which it can at least try to enforce whatever <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management"><span class="caps">DRM</span></a> strategies they have in mind.  TiVo is fighting so many other battles, believe me, this issue is the last one on its mind.  The &#8220;also-rans&#8221;, like Microsoft in the Media Center sphere, or SanDisk and iRiver in the <span class="caps">MP3</span> player sphere, have support, but it hasn&#8217;t exactly led to a groundswell of adoption.</p>


	<h2> Software</h2>


	<p>Software media players know that you&#8217;re going to play <span class="caps">MP3</span> files.  Not all of them expect you to want to play Ogg files.  You have to download plugins from who knows where.  Almost no one wants to do this, unless it is trivially easy.  I know for a fact that this is not the case with iTunes.  WinAmp is no longer so good that all the Windows uers are using it.  I have no idea what the status is for other players.  (I use <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">Foobar2000</a> and <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">amarok</a>, personally, both of those have built in support).</p>


	<h2> Laziness</h2>


	<p>Assume that all of those issues that I just mentioned did not exist, and the format was natively supported on every <span class="caps">MP3</span> player you could find.  The Ogg format would still very likely to be unadopted.</p>


	<p>Any music fan with more than just a scattering few files would take a long time to convert.  Their files would actually sound even worse if they converted from <span class="caps">MP3</span> and not the original source.  <span class="caps">MP3</span> has already been the beneficary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">Network Effect</a>.</p>


	<h2>Being a Leaf Doesn&#8217;t Matter</h2>


	<p>Ogg may be more flexible, but it is not more compatible.  It&#8217;s the province of geeks.  I can get the format to work better for me than <span class="caps">MP3</span>.  But it doesn&#8217;t matter, because the format is on the wrong end of the <span class="caps">MP3</span> network effect.  It doesn&#8217;t stand a chance of &#8220;tipping&#8221; in the next few years because there&#8217;s no connector ready to get the format adopted in all the places I mention above.</p>


	<p>Almost all successful open source software has a clear benefit to its competition from the point of view of the <strong>user</strong>.  In the <span class="caps">MP3</span>/Ogg battle, it carries a cost.</p>


	<h2>Stop Worrying</h2>


	<p>So I&#8217;m giving in.  My own personal plan for a music archive will allow me to choose Ogg in the future without too much trouble should the landscape ever change, but for now, the accursed 192Kbps <span class="caps">MP3</span> is my encoded format of choice.</p>


	<p>I guess the most salient force Ogg has in the market now is keeping the <span class="caps">MP3</span> license from being too expensive. Too bad!</p>
