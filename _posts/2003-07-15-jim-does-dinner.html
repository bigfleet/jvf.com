<p>The recipe was the sauce for a Jamaican Jerk sauce.  I&#8217;ll provide it, because I like to share.</p>


	<p>From <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563058669/jimvanfleetco-20">The Barbecue! Bible</a> by Steven Raichlen:</p>


<ul>
<li>2 to 16 scotch bonnet chiles.  Habeneros also work.</li>
<li>2 bunches scallions, white and green parts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
<li>1/2 medium onion, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
<li>1 piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 2 teaspoons dry</li>
<li>2 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons (kosher or sea) salt</li>
<li>1 tablesppon firmly packed brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Combine the chiles, scallions, onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor and process until finely chopped.</li>
<li>Add the thyme, allspice, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, vinegar, soy sauce, oil, salt and sugar and process to a smooth purï¿½e.</li>
</ol>

	<p>There you go!  That&#8217;s the sauce.  I&#8217;m not going to do the whole recipe, which yields yummy pork tenderloins.  I highly recommend the book, it&#8217;s got plenty of great dishes even for people who eat things beside meat.</p>
