<p>So, Monday was a big day.  I had a phone interview for a position at Capital One, and a teleconference with Seba concerning the conclusion of a contracting job.  The interview went OK, and the teleconference couldn&#8217;t have gone better.  After that, me and Mom went to go watch School of Rock, which I&#8217;ll give a full review tomorrow probably.</p>


	<p>Today was a lot of fun, too.  I took delivery on the new Outkast album, and my birthday present for my dad.  I also got two books on database theory that will really help me with these contracting gigs if I keep doing that in the future.  I got my Virginia Driver&#8217;s License&#8212;that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m a resident now.</p>


	<p>My second Madden season has reached 9-10.  David Carr is leading the league in QB Rating, TD&#8217;s, and yardage.  I went 23 of 26 for 523 yards and 10 TD&#8217;s against the Colts.  Stacey Mack is leading the league in yardage and TD&#8217;s.  The top two receivers are Corey Bradford (?!) and Andre Johnson.  Andre was out for a month, which helped Corey out.  Billy Miller has emerged as the league&#8217;s best tight end, but I&#8217;ll probably trade him, because Bernie Joppru is right on his footsteps in all categories, and he&#8217;s a better blocker when the time comes for that.  The Dolphins are 9-0 as well, so our meeting will determine home field for the playoffs, it appears.  My defense has become a juggernaut, second only to Miami&#8217;s in all categories.</p>


	<p>So it kind of looks like things are clicking on all cylinders.  I find out tomorrow whether I get to have a real interview and take the Capital One test.  Here&#8217;s hoping.</p>
