<p>It&#8217;s been three weeks since my last post.  Three weeks!  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more sad&#8212;the fact that it&#8217;s been that long or the fact that there really hasn&#8217;t been a development anywhere.  At least, one that&#8217;s any of your business.</p>


	<p>Punks.</p>


	<p>I am headed to New York tomorrow, though, and that should be fun.  More when I get back, and maybe I&#8217;ll be able to drop some science from the road.</p>
