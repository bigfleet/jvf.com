<p>Guess who cooked today&#8217;s hit dish?  I can&#8217;t claim all the credit.  Mom had the recipe (bourbon sweet potatos) and helped with the prep.  But I did most of the work!  I also put together the sausage dressing, but that wasn&#8217;t nearly as good.  This was the most I remember enjoying a Thanksgiving in quite some time.</p>


	<p>And the Packers and the Cowboys got beat.  How great is that?</p>
