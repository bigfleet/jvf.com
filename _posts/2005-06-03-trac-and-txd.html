<p>I have recently fallen in love with <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a>, as it combines a Wiki, an excellent bug tracker, some rudimentary project controls, and a source code browser into one package.</p>


	<p>I already fell in love with <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> where my <strong><span class="caps">VCII</span></strong> status gives me shared hosting for life.</p>


	<p>Now with <a title="Running Trac on TxD |" href="http://manuals.textdrive.com/read/chapter/54#page108">Running Trac on TxD</a>, I can combine the two.  You should check them both out!</p>
