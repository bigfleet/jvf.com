<p>I am hosting a <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/pages/geek-dinner">Richmond Geek Dinner</a> in one month, June 22nd, 2006 at <a href="http://www.thebullandbearclub.com/">The Bull And Bear Club</a> in downtown Richmond.</p>


	<p>There will be free wine, provided courtesy of <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh MacLeod</a> and his <a href="http://www.thehughpage.com/Stormhoek%27s_100_Geek_Dinners_in_100_Days">100 Geek Dinners in 100 Days</a> program, which looks like it may reach its numbers shortly as of this posting.</p>


	<p>For those who have expressed concern about the price, please visit the first link about this dinner.  The Bull And Bear Club does have a dress code, but it is not an expensive place to eat, necessarily.  There are many sandwhiches and chicken dishes available for less than $10.  Presumably, this is how much a dinner out would cost you.</p>
