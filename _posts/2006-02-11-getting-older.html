<p>I turn 27 on February 13.  That seems pretty old to me.  My man Dan Castle hypothesizes that it may be the extra syllable, and I believe that factor cannot be discounted.</p>


	<p>I must say that I am more and more disconcerted by the difference in ages between myself and college athletes.  (I am a big sports fan, after all.)</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t have any reason to belabor this point, but I thought I&#8217;d throw it out there.  27 seems a lot more odd to me than seeing 2006 for the first time, but I suppose that I&#8217;ll have to get over it.</p>
