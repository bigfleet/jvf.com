<p>I had a good time while I was watching &#8220;The Grifters&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069I1U/jimvanfleetco-20, don&#8217;t get me wrong.  And not just because of Annette Bening&#8217;s boobies, which you see plenty of.  John Cusack is enjoyable as always.  One of the things I like about Cusack is that you can rely on him not to overact.  Crime movies can get trashy in a hurry if that&#8217;s all their characters &#8220;do, say, make, think&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006357T /jimvanfleetco-20.</p>


	<p>This movie steers clear of that problem.  It&#8217;s not a movie about crime, scams, and grifting.  That&#8217;s what the main characters do, but the movie is about them.  You&#8217;ve got two women going after whatever they want, and not being inclined to stop when they encounter resistance.  You&#8217;ve got a guy in the middle convinced he can play it his own way right through this stuff.</p>


	<p>The events at the end really start straining credulity.  I will try never to spoil movies here, so the only thing I&#8217;ll say is that it seems inconsistent that Angelica Huston&#8217;s character would be so thoughtless at time when she&#8217;s so together otherwise.  That, of course, is in the script, not her performace, which is really very good.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll also say that you will enjoy the movie a lot more if you accept, from the very beginning, that Lily (Huston) <strong>is</strong> Roy&#8217;s <cusack> mother.  The climax of the film will be much more exciting than if you&#8217;re waiting the entire movie for a revelation that she&#8217;s not, that it&#8217;s some kind of elaborate con on you, the viewer.</p>


	<p>I give it a solid <strong>7/10</strong>.  It loses two points for the &#8220;So What?/Nothing New&#8221; factor and one point for the questionable wrapup.  Come to think of it, let&#8217;s make it a <strong>7.5/10</strong> with an extra .5 for the cast, which does a great job.</p>
