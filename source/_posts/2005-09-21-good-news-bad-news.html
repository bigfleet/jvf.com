<p>The good news is that I&#8217;ve been offered a full-time position at <a href="http://www.dominion-medical.com/">the company I&#8217;ve been working for since Christmas</a>.</p>


	<p>The bad news is that the salary they&#8217;ve offered represents a serious paycut (about 20%) of what they&#8217;re currently paying me as a contractor.</p>


	<p>The benefits are good (perhaps very good), but I just don&#8217;t know if the numbers work together.  Megan and I just did our budget, and it looks just right to me at my current salary.</p>


	<p>I am very nervous right now, but it&#8217;s the good kind of nervous that comes with a big opportunity.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll make sure to keep all of you up to date on what&#8217;s going on.</p>
