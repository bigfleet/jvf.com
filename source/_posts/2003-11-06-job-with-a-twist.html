<p>So, even though my boss said he&#8217;d try not to throw me into the deep end&#8212;there I am!  I&#8217;ve been requested by the QA/QC (that&#8217;s Quality Assurance/Quality Control for the non-droids out there) department head to come take a look at their processes.  So now I&#8217;m glad I read that consulting book!</p>


	<p>In other job news, the miscellaneous web tasks have been no problem.  Work on the web application framework is progressing well, and when I&#8217;m finished, I should have something pretty nice to offer the public.  Yeah, sure, you probably could care less, but I&#8217;ve spent almost a week on it now, so somebody will appreciate the Google search that turns that up!</p>


	<p>But I still love the job.  There&#8217;s so much I&#8217;m learning so quickly&#8230;  I&#8217;ll make my mistakes and take my bumps, but this is a time in my life I can do something like this.  Just work and work like crazy.</p>
