<p>I saw <a href="http://www.builttospill.com/">Built To Spill</a> at the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodtheatre.com/">Neighborhood Theater</a> here in Charlotte earlier this month.  I almost didn&#8217;t go because I felt a little low energy, but I couldn&#8217;t be happier that I did.  It was an excellent introduction to live music here in Charlotte.  They closed their set with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Built+to+Spill/_/Carry+the+Zero">Carry The Zero</a>, a song that I named one of my favorite mix CD&#8217;s after&#8212;ten years ago!  Unreal.</p>


	<p>Also interesting was the discovery that rock and roll is still alive&#8212;and it looks like my dad!  I can&#8217;t find any pictures of what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Martsch">Doug Martsch</a> is looking like these days, but he&#8217;s not going to be on <span class="caps">TRL</span> anytime soon.  I bought a cigarette off a beggar for 75 cents.  I&#8217;m not sure whether to feel depressed or whether I was actually showing him the way up and out of poverty.</p>


	<p>Last night, Megan and I went to see <a href="http://www.gregbrown.org/">Greg Brown</a> at the <a href="http://www.charlottecultureguide.com/organization.php?id=78">McGlohon Theater</a>.  An <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=609730463">old friend</a> got me into Greg Brown <strong>more</strong> than ten years ago. I saw him in Knoxville&#8217;s Laurel Theater ages ago.  This show was a lot more bluesy, but he was still personable and so relaxed.  He broke a string, and retuned the guitar and finished the song with more aplomb than some other musicians do a whole solo.</p>


	<p>I was amazed at how intimate the venue was.  Incredible.  Megan got very distracted at some of our fellow concertgoers&#8212;you must learn to tune them out, grasshopper!  We took the light rail into uptown to try that out.  It will be worth it for ballgames, but overall I thought the most impressive part of the light rail was getting a fuller view of Charlotte itself.  There is definitely a lot to like about this city.  I&#8217;m feeling very at home.</p>
