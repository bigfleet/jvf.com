My back injury kept me away from the disc golf course for quite awhile, but since it looks like the cold part of winter here in Charlotte lasts about three weeks (fine by me!), I got to looking at disc golf courses here in Charlotte and whipped this up.
<small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=102729094986561829591.00045fa9ede3621ebc7a6&amp;t=h&amp;ll=35.352214,-80.773539&amp;spn=0.821555,1.164678&amp;source=embed">View Larger Map</a></small>

In the interface itself, the links never looked like they were working, so I stopped doing it.  I see now that they do work!  But I think it came together well!  For those of you who like shorter things <a href="http://tinyurl.com/clt-discgolf-map">http://tinyurl.com/clt-discgolf-map</a> is usable.
