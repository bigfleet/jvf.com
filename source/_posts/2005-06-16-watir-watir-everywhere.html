<p>After getting a link from <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/KneeTesting.rdoc">Dave Thomas</a>, I checked out the link below.  Following some leads from that blog, I uncovered <a title="Watir: Web Application Testing in Ruby" href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir: Web Application Testing in Ruby</a>.  Watir is designed to drive Internet Explorer (yes, that Internet Explorer) using a Ruby script.</p>


	<p>This sounds like a dream addition to the testing stack.  Especially if this is a way to slip Ruby in the door.  Stay tuned for more details.</p>
