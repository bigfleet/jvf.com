<p>I&#8217;ve settled on using <a title="Ruby Editor Plugin for jEdit - Download" href="http://www.jedit.org/ruby/download/">jEdit with a plug-in</a> for my Ruby coding.  I&#8217;ve found that having the core <span class="caps">API</span> handy may actually come out higher on the cost/benefit ratio that code completion.  I really don&#8217;t even miss Ctrl+space.</p>


	<p>I am working on one major project in Ruby involving a web application and one minor one involving my <span class="caps">MP3</span> collection.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>:  I have since changed gears and gone with Eclipse and <span class="caps">RDT</span>.  You can find a  <a href="http://www.napcs.com/howto/railsonwindows.html">fabulous walkthrough for Eclipse and Ruby on Rails</a> at <span class="caps">NAPCS</span>.</p>
