<ul>
<li>I still don&#8217;t have a job.  Amentra balked at my request not to travel.  Would have been nice to have that job.
</li>
<li>I hope beyond hope that a check from Chuck is at my house and that I&#8217;ll be sending off the laptop very soon now.
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m preparing to pass a Java Certified Programmer exam.  I did pass the mock exam I took, but I want to study some of the topics a bit more before I take the actual test.  Hopefully it&#8217;ll help me find this job.
</li>
<li>Things are looking better for me getting down to East Tennessee at the first part of the year.  That&#8217;d be a good trip.  I&#8217;d like to see Ashley and Jay and all my <i>um</i> dead friend&#8217;s relatives.  Meep.</li>
<li>
Man, am I poor.  Still got my bills paid, though!
