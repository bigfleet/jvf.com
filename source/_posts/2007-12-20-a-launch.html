<p>I have been working at <a href="http://www.tradeking.com/">TradeKing</a> since the beginning of September, and <a href="http://community.tradeking.com/">the site</a> that I (and <a href="http://www.thinkrelevance.com/">others</a>) have been working on will be launched to the public tomorrow.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a great site, and I am very happy with my change in brokerage, regardless of my employment status.  If you are a stockholder, consider transferring your assets to TradeKing.  You can&#8217;t beat the price, and the customer support is top-notch.  You also get to play around and shoot me nasty messages if you find any bugs in the community site.  What could be better than that?</p>
