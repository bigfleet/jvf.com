<p>One of Megan&#8217;s students asked her a question for her government survey: &#8220;Do you feel safer now than you did before 9/11?&#8221;</p>


	<p>I have the hardest time even beginning to answer that question.  Is this supposed to be a referendum on Bush&#8217;s performance?  A meditation on security?  An invitation to layman speculation about the potential of a terrorist attack on Richmond, Virginia and/or Houston, Texas?</p>


	<p>Feel free to add your own impressions.</p>
