<ul>
	<li>I notice that my readership has almost doubled without my even doing anything.  Congratulations to you all for your delightful lack of taste.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve changed around the sidebar.  Big whoop.  I&#8217;m almost done tagging all of my old posts (did you notice the increase in linkroll traffic?)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>My family is with my sister, helping her to settle in her new environment down in Florida.  She&#8217;s preparing to spend this coming semester at New College of South Florida.  She&#8217;s excited and at the beach&#8212;that&#8217;s a pretty good combo.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I realized that Megan and I saw Mos Def and Talib Kweli this year and didn&#8217;t even blog about it.  I should have my privileges revoked.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am doing a lot of writing at work which is sort of dampening my enthusiasm for writing here lately.  Too bad, because a lot of things have been happening.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I am trying to help put the finishing touches on the first major web application written for <span class="caps">CISV</span>.  It&#8217;s being written in Ruby on Rails, and I feel it&#8217;s been going well.  We just need to put some largely finishing touches on it and we&#8217;ll be in good shape.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Megan and I once again had a blast at a show featuring her friend Chris Eldridge.  He is part of <a href="http://www.thestringdusters.com/bio.htm">The Stringdusters</a>  who, as I understand, have been signed to a major label.  They play &#8220;newgrass&#8221;, they say.  Whatever that is.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I feel like I&#8217;ve really found a good place at work&#8212;I seem to be just the kind of person that the company is looking for, and they seem to be the company I&#8217;ve been looking for.  I would be surprised if this wasn&#8217;t my last job for a long time.  After this, I go out on my own in one way or another.  (I may have this job for quite some time.)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m working on a secret project at work, so <strong><span class="caps">OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH</span></strong> aren&#8217;t I special?</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>The Notwist are good.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;ve become part of some sort of nutty geek order; we&#8217;ll see how that turns out.</li>
	</ul>
