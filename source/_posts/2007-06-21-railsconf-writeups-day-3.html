<p>For me, this was the slowest day of the conference by design.  I was so exhausted, and my feet hurt so badly that I wondered if I would even make it to the keynote in the morning.  I did manage to get there without too much problem, and the Aleve that I brought came in extremely handy.</p>


	<p>My day included:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="/2007/6/21/railsconf-writeups-exploring-virtual-clusters-for-rails-development-and-deployment">Exploring Virtual Clusters for Rails Development and Deployment</a></li>
		<li><a href="/2007/6/21/railsconf-writeups-memcaching-rails">Memcaching Rails</a></li>
		<li><a href="/2007/6/21/railsconf-writeups-the-dark-art-of-developing-plugins">The Dark Art of Developing Plugins</a></li>
		<li>A short brain break</li>
		<li><strong>Open Mic Demo Session</strong> which I was asked to leave because my presence established a fire hazard.  Whatever.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>During the Memcaching session, I missed my own solitary mention &#8220;on the floor&#8221; in the Joyent Slingshot presentation when I was mentioned as having worked on porting an application to it.  I later got together with the person who was asking about it&#8212;Luke Melia is a commiter on Tracks.</p>


	<p>Jon, a friend of his, and I walked out to McMenamin&#8217;s for dinner.  Jon didn&#8217;t like the beer that I got (It was named Ruby!) but the meal was decent.  After that, we walked back to the hotel and called it a day.</p>


	<p>We ended up seeing a <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/762673.html">clip I had shown Jon at the start of the day</a> on Inside Edition.  Jon and I were both tickled because we are evil persons.  When I reminded him of the clip, he sent me a link to a <a href="http://rpgs.joystiq.com/2007/06/05/todays-best-sfx-video-street-fighter-2-dancer-vs-baby/">better one</a>.</p>
