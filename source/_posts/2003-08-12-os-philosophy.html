<p>It&#8217;s not my rant, but it is funny.  Neal Stephenson, the author of Cryptonomicon (among others), whipped up this impressive work called <a href="http://www.spack.org/index.cgi/InTheBeginningWasTheCommandLine">In The Beginning, There Was The Command Line</a>.  I don&#8217;t know why he did it, but it&#8217;s easier to read than you might expect for a piece on the history of operating systems.  You&#8217;ll know more than you did when you started, probably.</p>


	<p>I might eventually write an expanded entry with my own comments on the work, but I was reminded of this piece&#8217;s existence this morning and wanted to get it up.</p>
