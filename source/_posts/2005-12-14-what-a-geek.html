<p>I know, only like two of you care about all this geekery.</p>


	<p>In general, my life is going well.  Megan and I are having a lot of fun, as always.  We&#8217;re gearing up to send invitations out for our holiday party on the 30th.  (Save the date, if you&#8217;re reading&#8230;)</p>


	<p>My job at <a href="http://www.alterthought.com/">ALTERThought</a> has been a challenge, but not in the ways that I expected.  I do feel, thought, that I am beginning to settle there.  I enjoy the people I work with there more than I have since college, so that&#8217;s a big plus.  The job itself still has a lot of unexpected facets, so as I&#8217;m more fully settled, you&#8217;ll hear more from me here.</p>


	<p>With the way I&#8217;ve been feeling, that&#8217;s been enough to pretty much fill my day.  I got my mom a flat-panel monitor for Christmas and her birthday.  She badly needed it for desk control.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting my dad something a little different.  I want to get him blogging since he has a lot of great ideas he&#8217;d love to share, and he&#8217;s looking for a job.  My Mom and Dad have always been very with it, and I want to help bring him up to the cutting edge of the job search sphere.</p>


	<p>(Mom set up her own <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and <span class="caps">SMTP</span> client once.  Beat <strong>that</strong>, other moms!)</p>
