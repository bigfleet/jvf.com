<p>Over the past couple of weekends, it&#8217;s been hard for me to keep my spirits up.  I don&#8217;t have very many friends left in town that I see all that often, and I&#8217;m really getting tired of hours and hours by myself in my apartment.</p>


	<p>So this weekend, I&#8217;m headed up to Austin to stay with Eric Furbish, a friend of mine who&#8217;s living there.  (I&#8217;d link to his homepage but it&#8217;s <strong>naked!</strong>)  Eric, for goodness sakes, hide that directory listing with a web page.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll drop a line detailing what we&#8217;ll get into.</p>


	<p>Also, I&#8217;m adding a new poll having to do with some questions about the site.  It&#8217;s really breaking my heart that three people have voted in the poll, one of them being myself.  I&#8217;ll hope it&#8217;s because you found the poll topic entirely uninspiring rather than no one&#8217;s visiting any more.  <i>(sigh)</i></p>
