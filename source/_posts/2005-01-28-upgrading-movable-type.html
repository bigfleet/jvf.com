<p>I&#8217;ve upgraded <a href="http://www.movabletype.com">MovableType</a>, the blogging software that I run, to the latest version, thanks to a not-too-thinly veiled threat from Dreamhost to <strong>shut me down</strong> if I didn&#8217;t do so.</p>


	<p>Why, you might ask?  Comment spam.  Ricky referred to it as &#8220;grafitti&#8221;, which is wildly more preferable.</p>


	<p>Anyway, comment spam is a fact of life now, so we have to live with it.  I&#8217;ll be posting a follow-up here with how to register yourself as a commenter on MovableType systems at <a href="http://www.typekey.com">TypeKey</a>.  But I&#8217;ve already spent enough time on this today, so it&#8217;ll have to wait.</p>
