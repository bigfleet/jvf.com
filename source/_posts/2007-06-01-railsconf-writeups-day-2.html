<p>Friday was the first &#8220;real day&#8221; of the conference, with <span class="caps">DHH</span>&#8217;s opening keynote (well summarized by Patrick Reagan <a href="http://blog.viget.com/tech/2007/05/20/whats-coming-in-rails-20/">here</a>) and the first day of sessions.  You&#8217;ll have to wait for my own summary post on the entire conference to get my impressions of the keynote speakers.</p>

	<p>After that, Jon, Patrick and I had a horrible dinner at American Cowgirls which I will now erase from my memory forever.  After that, we walked to some bar whose name I can&#8217;t remember where I fell asleep in a chair on the back patio.  We took a cab back to the hotel, and I relished my good fortune.</p>
