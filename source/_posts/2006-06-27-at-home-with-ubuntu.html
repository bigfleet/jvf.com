<h3>Roadblocks</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get some version of Linux installed in one way or another on one of my machines for a very long time.  A good portion of the work I do is still very unfriendly towards Windows.  It never worked because I could never get an install working with all my commodity hardware working.  I may be a geek, but recompiling a kernel is not something I&#8217;m eager to learn how to do.  If I can&#8217;t figure out how to work around the problem in 15 minutes with Google, forget it.</p>


	<p>With Ubuntu, this problem is solved in the extreme.  When I was last decontaminating my parent&#8217;s computer from its spyware infestation, I had to rebuild the machine from scratch.  Seeing my opportunity to move one step closer to not having to support Windows any longer, I took the opportunity to install Ubuntu Breezy (the latest version at the time).  The install was over, with everything working, in about 30 minutes.  I even had the printer installed and working as well as the e-mail client set up.</p>


	<p>With Windows, it took <span class="caps">HOURS</span>.  And I was lucky that I knew to save everything in the <em>C:\DELL</em> folder very carefully or I&#8217;d be spending even more time downloading drivers.  I was blown away by the fact that on commodity hardware, Linux was an easier install for me than Windows was.</p>


	<h3>The Beautiful Part</h3>


	<p>Ubuntu Dapper is free.  It&#8217;s free as in &#8220;free beer.&#8221;  You can go to the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu website</a> and request that they ship you a CD.  It&#8217;s free as in &#8220;free speech&#8221;.  If I were so inclined, I could download the source code and figure out how to change anything I might want to change.  Fix typos, etc. in my case.  Other people can do more.  I&#8217;d then have to speak to a friendly developer to get it actually incorporated into <strong>everyone&#8217;s</strong> copy, but that is the idea.  Anyone can contribute.  That&#8217;s a powerful idea.</p>


	<h3>My Own Dapper Install</h3>


	<h4>Web Applications</h4>


	<p>That&#8217;s what I do, and getting them set up on Dapper wasn&#8217;t a problem in the slightest.  Sun has allowed Linux developers to package the Sun version of Java with Linux, which is like upgrading from a Pinto to a Cadillac.</p>


	<p>I also run a version of Atlassian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a> product, since they are currently giving away personal licenses free.  That means I can use Confluence, the finest Wiki I&#8217;ve encountered, as my personal scrapbook.  I like that.</p>


	<p>I already mentioned that I am <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/06/09/making-tracks">using Tracks</a>.  That was dependent on my Ruby and Rails setup, which I&#8217;ll be detailing soon.  I&#8217;m hoping that post will be good enough to make the rounds a little bit.</p>


	<h4>Installing Apps</h4>


	<p>The package management system has been my second major stumbling block in terms of Linux adoption.  Debian makes this a no-brainer.  The apt-get system is simply brilliant.</p>


	<h3> Not So Fast</h3>


	<p>I am not anywhere close to leaving Windows entirely behind.  Some web applications still require Internet Explorer to function.  There&#8217;s still no real equivalent to Microsoft Money that I&#8217;ve found.  TiVo Desktop is still a Windows application.  Fortunately, I have an older machine that can handle XP and I just <span class="caps">RDP</span> into it when I need to.  A small price to pay!</p>
