<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right.  I finally gave in and started a blog.  Maybe there&#8217;s a chance that the &#8220;small changes&#8221; idea of the blog will actually finally solve my problem of not being able to assemble a ton of content all at once.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll be experimenting with the form of things and thinking through the structure I&#8217;d like to have in place here.  But mostly I&#8217;m doing this just to feel good, my past couple of days have really sucked.</p>
