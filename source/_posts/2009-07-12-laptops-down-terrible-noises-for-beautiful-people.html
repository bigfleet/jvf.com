Misha Glouberman's contribution to our lovely conference was not technical in nature.  It was a shared experiment in becoming a cellular automata that generated sound.  It was a lovely experience!<!--more-->First, we were to generate a specific noise as a group.  We rotated through a vowel sound, a hiss or shush sound, and any noise you could make with your hands.

We then would try different "games" like having the group spontaneously switch from one to another, or making a particular noise as a spatula travelled through the crowd.  We also had a simulation of the game of Life where if you were too lonely or too crowded, you'd stop making your sound.

It was a very welcome break and pallet cleanser for the brain.  A very interesting interlude, and if it sounds intriguing to you, you can read more at the website for the <a href="http://www.schooloflearning.org/">School of Learning</a>.
