<p>Three balls in the hopper:</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m very close to the end of my previous job at Dominion Medical Management.  It&#8217;s been tough for me to create the time I need to work on it while staying sane.  Fortunately, I am very close to done.  Working on plain old Java webapps suddenly seems like the farthest thing from my mind, but it&#8217;s good to know that I can do it in a pinch.</p>


	<p>I no longer technically work for ALTERthought.  The work I did with a new client that I was assigned to proved to be fruitful enough that we&#8217;ve partnered together on a new venture.  As such, my contract has been assigned.  Or something.  I&#8217;m vague on the details, but my paycheck is coming from a new place.</p>


	<p>The new venture is called Canal Street Capital (don&#8217;t bother, we don&#8217;t have a website yet).  Our goal is to create a hedge fund.  I don&#8217;t want to get too far into the details of what I&#8217;m doing before we get input from the law team, since we&#8217;re talking about real money now.  It&#8217;s an extremely exciting project&#8212;one that uses almost everything I&#8217;ve learned either formally at Rice or informally on my own.  I hope to be able to provide more details soon.</p>
