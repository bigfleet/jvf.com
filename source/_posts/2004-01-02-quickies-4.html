<ul>
<li>Going to a show in DC tomorrow night!  <a href="http://www.definitivejux.net/tours/archives/okay_player_tour.html">Check it out!</a></li>
<li>I payed off my Discover card a couple of days ago.  I&#8217;m only a month or so from positive net worth for the first time since my junior year at Rice!</li>
<li><span class="caps">FSU</span> could miss a thousand field goals against Miami, and I&#8217;d never get tired of it</li>
<li>I know I&#8217;m totally lagging in the communications aspect with everyone, but it seems like I&#8217;ve been so busy.  I know I&#8217;m not always, but it seems like it.</li>
<li>Due to an ill-advised move back to Windows 2000 on my desktop, I&#8217;ve lost a good deal of data.  This normally does not happen to me.  My Eudora mailboxes seem very corrupted, and that&#8217;s simply not acceptible!  I&#8217;ll have to correct it at some point, but I&#8217;m thinking about going all webmail.  If you&#8217;ve done so with success, let me know</li>
<li>Working out in the morning has been working like a charm.  That part, at least.  I&#8217;m very sore today, though&#8212;it&#8217;s been about a month since I got in there for the weightlifting.  Maybe I&#8217;ll make it tomorrow, maybe I won&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s definitely becoming a part of my day.</li>
<li>I only have two resolutions: stick to my behavior plan (don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll see it soon) and lose my gut.  Maybe I&#8217;d feel good enough to try to make some friends here without the <strong>belly!</strong>  Your days are numbered, pauncho.</li>
</ul>
