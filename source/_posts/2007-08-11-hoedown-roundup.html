<p>Ezra&#8217;s Merb presentation was useful for someone like me with no exposure to the framework, but could have been sexier.  Where&#8217;s our 10 minute blog app?</p>


	<p>Adhearsion looks like it might make <span class="caps">VOIP</span> accessible to me, which is a pretty ridiculous notion.  If you&#8217;re thinking <span class="caps">VOIP</span> and Ruby, think Adhearsion.  I know the speaker is probably frustrated that his demo didn&#8217;t come off at the end, but that was going to be incredible if he pulled it off.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve heard Bruce Tate speak a number of times, but it&#8217;s clear to me that getting out of the Java sphere has actually been good for his psyche.  He speaks with a lot more passion now and asks interesting questions.  He&#8217;s not the only one asking them, but I think it&#8217;s pretty likely that some of my fellow attendees could really get something out of reflecting on his talk.</p>


	<p>Our social schedule led to missing the games development talk.  Ooops!</p>


	<p>The lightning round was relatively informative, and I preferred it to what I saw during the security talk at RailsConf.</p>


	<p>The birds of a feather session that I attended about using Rails for social good included discussion of a mailing list that I hope ends up happening.</p>


	<p>The presenters on the second day after that all did a great job.  Ken Ault gave a great talk about the Rails ecosystem and how the interrelations were important for Smalltalk and what Ruby can learn.  Smalltalk got a lot of &#8220;face-time&#8221; this weekend.</p>


	<p>Jared Richardson gave a really illuminating talk on the interrelationship between C and Ruby.</p>


	<p>Both talks I&#8217;m going to watch again at some point, and I think that&#8217;s one of the highest compliments I can pay.</p>


	<p>Marcel Molina wrapped up with a talk on beauty which really wasn&#8217;t to my tastes, although clearly many people in the crowd responded well to it.</p>


	<p>Overall, I think the organizers and the presenters did an incredible job of getting a lineup of interesting speakers and topics together in a place, delivering a great value, and bringing it off almost without a hitch.  Awesome job, and I give my compliments to everyone involved.</p>
