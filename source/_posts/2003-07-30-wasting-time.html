<p>I&#8217;ve looked for Legend of the Red Dragon on line for a long time, having played it a great deal in <span class="caps">BBS</span>&#8217;es in high school.  Because I am a big dork, I remember getting my e-mail through them, eons ago.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I <a href="http://klomdark.servebeer.com:8081/rotfoh/">found one</a> that works and works well!</p>
