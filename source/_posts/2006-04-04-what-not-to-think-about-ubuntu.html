<p>&#8220;Well, they say they want another few weeks to polish the release for commercial support.  Surely it&#8217;s OK for me to go ahead and pin myself to dapper and upgrade my distribution&#8230;&#8221;</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m still recovering.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m no longer running FreeBSD at all, nor do I even have a Windows partition (although I do wish I could find my disc so that I can install XP in my VMWare&#8212;that is, when I get my OS back into a reasonable state).  Ubuntu is really fantastic, but it can make a neophyte overconfident very easily.</p>
