<p>A Philadelphia Phillies fan was <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=582&#38;e=4&#38;u=/nm/20031009/wr_nm/nl_phillies_spam_dc">arrested for spamming Philly papers</a>, and many other people.  I actually got a few of these spams.  I know I kept some of them for awhile;  they were actually well-written and very well thought out.  I didn&#8217;t exactly thing it was the best forum, but they were at least interesting.</p>


	<p>Why can&#8217;t they arrest the people who keep trying to get me to increase my breast size?</p>
