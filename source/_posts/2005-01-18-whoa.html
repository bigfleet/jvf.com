<p>Boring as it might be, I produced a document that is the <a title="Google Search: hyades tomcat" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;lr=&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#38;q=hyades tomcat&#38;btnG=Search">#1 rated link on Google Search</a> for it&#8217;s term.  Sure it&#8217;s &#8220;hyades tomcat,&#8221; but at least it&#8217;s something!</p>
