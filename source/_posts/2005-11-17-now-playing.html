<p>The Clientele is what happens when you mix Slowdive with the Olivia Tremor Control.  Very nice.</p>


	<p>The Wolf Parade appears to be The Arcade Fire plus synthesizers, which I also like.</p>


	<p>I just don&#8217;t like the record from The Hold Steady.  Or the <span class="caps">LCD</span> Soundsystem.  So sue me.</p>


	<p>I am really digging the new Dangerdoom album.  <em>You know my rappin&#8217; is the #$^#$</em>!  I also like The Game&#8217;s Documentary album, despite what you might have suspected.</p>
