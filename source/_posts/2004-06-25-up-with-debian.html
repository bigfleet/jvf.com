<p>Thanks to <a title="LinuxQuestions.org - USB Keyboard: I need to load USB at startup time. - where Linux users come for help" href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&#38;threadid=197365&#38;highlight=usb keyboard">this post</a> about <span class="caps">USB</span> support in Linux, I&#8217;m now running two boxes in my office.  One is Windows XP, the other is now a Debian Linux installation.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve added the second box to help practice some of my build techniques without having to have the real remote server down.  Plus, it&#8217;s extra geek points!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got some <span class="caps">NFJS</span> reviews in the can.  Look for them to be up in the next couple of days.  Right now I&#8217;m doing some customer support.</p>
