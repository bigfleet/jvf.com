<p>For those of you out there who are still single, or even if you aren&#8217;t, <a href="http://www.okcupid.com">OK Cupid</a> is attempting to pull one over on  <a href="www.friendster.com">Friendster</a>.  It&#8217;s already far superior as a dating site, and now they&#8217;ve added the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/">Six Degrees</a> <a href="http://aries.mos.org/sixdegrees/">of Separation</a> factor for participants.</p>


	<p>So I&#8217;m inviting everyone to come open an account and let me add you as a real friend.  I guarantee that they are better then Friendster.</p>
