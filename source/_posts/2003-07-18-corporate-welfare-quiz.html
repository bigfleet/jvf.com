<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone visiting this site would be shocked to read my suggestion that American Industry and American Government are closely related.  But are you ready for a clearly biased, yet still informative quiz?</p>


	<p>Visit <a href="http://www.progress.org/banneker/igt/cw/">The Corporate Welfare Homepage Quiz</a>.  I scored a 124, which seems to be pretty good.  The quiz is definitely thought-provoking.  Make sure to stick with it at least until you reach the question concerning tax loopholes.</p>
