<li>Friday night, I saw The Faint and Bright Eyes again.  The Faint never fail to disappoint, and I&#8217;ll have some pictures of that up soon, hopefully.  I was a moron, and bought tickets for the wrong day, meaning I cheated myself out of some major $$$ last week.  Oh, well, I feel ten times better about the state of my friendship with Elizabeth, and you can&#8217;t put a price tag on that.</li>
<li>I helped Megan move out of her apartment this weekend.  We left the place looking really nice.  We hope to spend the returned deposit on furniture.</li>
<li>On the holiday yesterday, we went to play mini-golf where we both played quite well.  (I was -3, and she was +7, not bad for a first-timer on a <strong>par 54</strong> course.)  She probably saved me at least five strokes by letting me go first, keeping these annoying kids out of my buttcrack while on the tee-box.</li>
<li>
Important things to do this week.  Every week out of the next month is going to be pretty crucial in one way or another.  Check back next week to see what I got done and what I flaked on.

I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren&#8217;t for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can&#8217;t stay out of trouble. <a HREF="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a>
