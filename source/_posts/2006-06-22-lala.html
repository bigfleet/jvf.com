<p>The idea behind <a href="http://www.lala.com/">lala.com</a> is that of being the Internet&#8217;s used CD store.  Pick up albums you think you might like on the cheap, bring them back in if you don&#8217;t like them, trade them for something else.  To acquire a used CD (without liner notes or jewel case) is $1.49.  &#8220;Not a bad price!&#8221;  But you have to trade in your CD&#8217;s to get any out at all.</p>


	<p>My first thought on using the system was &#8220;I just input 150 of my CD&#8217;s, and I would trade two of these in, and <strong>might</strong> trade another two.&#8221;  What&#8217;s the big deal?</p>


	<p>But then, two things happened.  I got an impeccible copy of Alpha&#8217;s <em>The Impossible Thrill</em>, featuring liner notes and the artwork for the back of the jewel case.  Wow.</p>


	<p>I then spent a little more time exploring the site, and got my want list up to about 80 albums.  I am now rabidly looking through my list, thinking &#8220;I could go without that CD.  I <strong>want my orders filled!</strong>&#8221;  They&#8217;ve got me.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what lala&#8217;s all about, drop me a line.  I&#8217;ll be happy to send you an invite.</p>
