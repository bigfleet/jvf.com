<p>Wow, that pun is a bit much, even for me.</p>


	<p>At any rate, I&#8217;ve now <a title="TracOnFedoraCoreThree - The Trac Project - Trac" href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracOnFedoraCoreThree">installed Trac on Fedora Core 3</a> in conjunction with my project which is now coming down the home stretch.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this.  Even if I don&#8217;t get any additional use from it, the repository browsing capabilities are intriguing.</p>


	<p>More on this situation as it develops.</p>
