<h2>Mail</h2>


	<p>I have a good GMail system that I love.  I used it to sort through approximately 5,000 e-mails from over two years into a pile of less than 30.  Two wrenches are in those gears right now.  All my workstation time is on Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> now (yes!) and the new FireFox 3 betas are already the best browser there, in my opinion.  But <strong>curses</strong>! my Better GMail extension is not yet available!  Second wrench&#8212;I have to learn to get back to my starred messages (a.k.a. action items).  Take it to the next level.</p>


	<h2>Church</h2>


	<p>I joined a church, the <a href="http://www.uuccharlotte.org/"><span class="caps">UUCC</span></a>.  I think we&#8217;ll have more on that as it develops, but it&#8217;s one of the elements in our Charlotte life that Megan and I have already come to value very deeply.</p>


	<h2>Music</h2>


	<p>Megan made fun of me for calling a recent playlist &#8220;a mix tape,&#8221; because clearly it&#8217;s not getting anywhere near a cassette player.  We don&#8217;t even <strong>own</strong> a cassette player (although I still have a few of my <a href="http://www.ktru.org/"><span class="caps">KTRU</span></a> shows on tape&#8212;the dream lives on!).</p>


	<p>I simultaneously acknowledge that she is right, and rue the woeful downgrade in the coolness of sharing personal music.  A &#8220;playlist&#8221;?  Really?  A &#8220;mix&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even sound any better!  Do I have to send people the <span class="caps">MP3</span>&#8217;s or do I make a real CD?  Are they going to download these tracks?  Yuck.  Much less cool.</p>


	<p>Also, was having a Walkman ever cool?  I mean, people working out had them, and that was obviously cool.  But what about everyone else?</p>


	<h2>Music</h2>


	<p>On an related note, it blows my mind that having an iTunes library comprised largely of a network file share is such a problem.  I don&#8217;t want to keep 160GB of music on my hard drive.  <strong><span class="caps">HELLO</span>!</strong></p>


	<h2>Music, one more time (hit me!)</h2>


	<p>We didn&#8217;t go to a concert in Charleston, SC on Saturday night because <a href="/2008/3/22/the-boring-one-about-my-leg">my leg hurt so badly.</a>  We ended up having a low-key weekend with plenty of relaxation thrown in, as well as a haircut.</p>


	<h2>Money</h2>


	<p>Megan and I are also having budget talks.  It takes a long time to go from &#8220;we have no real way of tracking or planning for expenditures&#8221; to &#8220;we know what expenses we incur each month, and are planning to spend in ways that more closely match our values in the future.&#8221;  We are getting very close, but it&#8217;s been a journey filled of discoveries and new understandings.  I highly recommend it to everyone.</p>
