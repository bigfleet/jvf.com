<p>I&#8217;ve had a bit of an event happen at IdeaWeavers, where I was working with my friend Bill.  He was possibly facing cash flow issues, the consequences of which would have been dire.  We worked together to help him find a way to keep his business and keep his rent paid.  It all worked out, but one of the results was that I needed to find my own work.</p>


	<p>So I posted my resume on Monster and sent it around via e-mail yesterday, and now I&#8217;m headed out on an interview with <a href="http://www.amentra.com">Amentra,</a> which, at this very second, you know about as much as I do about.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the interview.  Sounds like it&#8217;s a good match for me.</p>


	<p>Look at how much can change so quickly!  What a month the past few have been.</p>
