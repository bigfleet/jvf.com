<p>I&#8217;ve been quite busy with the actual product I&#8217;ve put out.  Since I last posted (in no particular order)...</p>

<ul>
<li>The site has seen its two pilot groups debut almost without a hitch.</li>
<li>During development, I was assuming that we would have a potential concurrent user base in the hundreds.  It now is clear that the number is in the thousands.  This has led to a large amount of hard work for me that I don&#8217;t enjoy in a short amount of time.</li>
<li>The needs of the project in general are now larger than I can assuredly handle.  I&#8217;ve had to accept this and just be thankful that I still have a job each morning.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been offered a new job in principle.  The fellow who offered it to me will be back this week to discuss specifics.  Think: more pay, less work.</li>
<li>My current boss is in town this week to discuss where we are right now, and where we can be in the future.  Timing with above is intriguing.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve learned it is a possibility that the project could fail and it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be my fault;  one needs an entire team of non-developers for the project to be a success.  One good developer isn&#8217;t enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to post more in the near future, but who knows what tomorrow brings?</p>
