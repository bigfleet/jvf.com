<p>After seeing <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> pop up on my <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/delicious.html">del.icio.us</a>  popular page, I went and checked it out.  I tried using it on my barrel of <span class="caps">MP3</span>&#8217;s that I had no hope of ever fully classifying, or really figuring out where they came from.  I was shocked, not only at how well the program worked, but how easy it was to use.  It even respects how I name files, and will handle that for me as well!</p>


	<p>I still use <a href="http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm">Tag &#38; Rename</a> to finish up with assigning a year, and getting the directory structure exactly how I like it, but MusicBrainz has already become an indespensible part of my <span class="caps">MP3</span> stack.</p>


	<p>In short, if you have a lot of <span class="caps">MP3</span>&#8217;s, or you are an active downloader, please use a condom.</p>


	<p>Wait!  No, I mean, give <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> a try.</p>
