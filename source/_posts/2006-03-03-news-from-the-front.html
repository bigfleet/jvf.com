	<li> Megan and I continue to do well, although recently I think we&#8217;ve both been so exhausted that we aren&#8217;t doing a great deal after we get home from work and all our scheduled extra-curriculars.  I think we both want to refocus, but I&#8217;ll need to borrow some of her strength to say no sometimes.  There are so many good causes out there&#8230;</li>

	<li>Megan&#8217;s Academic Challenge team finished 3rd in the state for their school size!  I was their humble scorekeeper.  I had a lot of fun, both because her kids are great and because it was fun to get exposure to one of the high-school &#8220;sports&#8221; I liked doing.  It was a very impressive finish, and her team should be very proud.</li>

	<li>I&#8217;m seeing Mogwai tomorrow night.  It hasn&#8217;t really sunk in yet.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>We are very much enjoying our new oven.  Sometimes the little things, like having an oven that works on settings other than broil, are life&#8217;s true joys.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>I am working like a dog at work, but to call it an exciting project would be an understatement.  Nearly everything that I&#8217;ve learned either via formal instruction or as a hobby is being used in one form or another.  It&#8217;s best for me if I stay somewhat mum until we have some actual promotional material that I can point you towards.   I am at work right now, drinking a beer, though.  That&#8217;s a plus.  We beat our original target date for completion of what we&#8217;ve got thus far by six weeks.  I have a lot to do with that, as well, which feels great.  As soon as I get some rest&#8230;</li>

	<ul>
	<li>I am playing a game called <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">The Battle For Wesnoth</a> which was called &#8220;The OpenOffice of gaming: extensive, fascinating and free of charge&#8221; by one reviwer on their home page.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite games ever, which means that now is a particularly bad time to have found it.  I need to be doing something else!</li>
