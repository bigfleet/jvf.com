<p>I&#8217;ve both updgraded the blog to run off <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a> trunk, and rolled back to the default theme.</p>


	<p>I am working on a theme that I&#8217;ll use for this blog, just in case the <a href="http://typogarden.com/">Typo theme contest</a> doesn&#8217;t turn up any that I think are awesome.  I&#8217;ve abandoned the notebook look for now.</p>
