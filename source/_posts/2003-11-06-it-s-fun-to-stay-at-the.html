<p>I&#8217;m a <span class="caps">YMCA</span> member!  I signed up a couple days ago, and this morning I had my first workout.  They&#8217;ve got these wild machines that you identify yourself to, and they remember things like where you should put the pegs and seats, and how many reps to do at what weight.  They even beep at you to make sure that you&#8217;re doing the exercize appropriately.</p>


	<p>It also enables this great program they have to keep track of what they call <i>FitPoints</i> which sounds pretty lame, but it gives you immediate positive feedback about your workout.  They also give you cool stuff for racking up the points!  Just to show you it&#8217;s not all about the business model down at the Y&#8230;</p>


	<p>At any rate, I got about 300 with today&#8217;s one circuit on the weight machines and a half-hour cardio session.  I&#8217;ll be headed back tomorrow for more.  I must get that koozie.</p>
