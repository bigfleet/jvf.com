<p>I&#8217;m working on finding out what I can about this IT organization.  If you guys got to see what I&#8217;m doing, you&#8217;d be thinking &#8220;Our little baby&#8217;s all growns up.&#8221;  I certainly think so when I&#8217;m on the job.</p>


	<p>At first, I was kind of concerned because I had no experience.  But you really don&#8217;t need all kinds of experience sometimes to tell there&#8217;s problems when employees don&#8217;t talk to or respect management decisions.  As I&#8217;ve said a few times in the past couple of weeks, sometimes I&#8217;m amazed that anything happens in this world at all.  Progress sure seems a lot more odd.</p>


	<p>As for the software development side, the really exciting stuff, I got the laptop in and tied all the pieces of my framework together.  Just for shits and giggles, here&#8217;s the pieces:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gentleware.com/">Poseidon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Dreamweaver</a></li>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> of course </li>
<li><a href="http://www.salmonllc.com/sofia/"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a></li>
</ul>

	<p>Everything&#8217;s either <a href="http://www.gnu.org"><span class="caps">LGPL</span></a> or an equivalent, which means that you can use it freely even if you&#8217;re building proprietary software with it.  One metaphor I&#8217;ve seen that I really like referring to the Open Source movement is that it&#8217;s a war&#8212;only in this war when Open/Free software gains ground, it can&#8217;t be regained.</p>


	<p>Since I got everything tied up, things have kind of stalled.  There are many places that I could go next but what I&#8217;d like to do is finally get the requirements document done.  I&#8217;m very excited about the process that I&#8217;m using, almost as much as developing the product.  Products come and go, but if I have a working process, that&#8217;s like a license to print money.</p>


	<p>Maybe.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve got to hit the hay, even with my nap.  I haven&#8217;t packed and I need to split in about twelve hours.  I&#8217;m going to be doing a bunch of reading.  This is shaping up to be one unique vacation.</p>


	<p>Tell you all about it later!</p>
