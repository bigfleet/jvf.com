<p>Melvin Goes To Dinner was put together by the Mr. Show guys for Showtime.  &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they on <span class="caps">HBO</span>&#8221; you ask?  Well, sure.  But this is not Mr. Show.  This is basically one of those really exciting conversations you have with a group of friends when you&#8217;re all a little over enthusiastic because you&#8217;ve been drinking all night.  They talk about religion, sex, old boyfriends and new girlfriends, relationships, and the astral plane.</p>


	<p>They pulled it off pretty well!  The movie definitely picks up steam as it rolls along, and if you know me, you know I&#8217;m a sucker for pontification.  I give it a <strong>7.9/10</strong>.  It&#8217;s funny but you definitely will not kick yourself if you never see this movie.  I would definitely recommend an evening with your real friends over it.</p>
