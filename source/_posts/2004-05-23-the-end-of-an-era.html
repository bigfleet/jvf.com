<p>What a week!</p>


	<p>By the end of Thursday the 23rd, all of the necessary elements to complete my 360 feedback project were in place.  I&#8217;ll just be straightening up until the 1st.  Next week of work is my lightest in months.</p>


	<p>The project <i>knock on wood</i> looks to me like it will be a total success.  We&#8217;ve been kicking the tires on the remote server for weeks now.  I feel like I hit both date targets, even though I was lucky.  We were under budget.  Now all we need is a successful session or two, and that&#8217;ll be that.</p>


	<p>Also, I put down a deposit on a new place yesterday.  I&#8217;m moving out.  It&#8217;s an absolutely huge 2 bedroom in Richmond&#8217;s &#8220;Fan&#8221; area.  It&#8217;s the French Quarter, but more watered down and not French.  If I knew more about the Montrose area in Houston, I might say it was similar to that.  2,200 sq. ft for $850 a month is nice.  The house is almost a hundred years old.  Corner stores, markets, restaurants, and bars are all within walking distance.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;ll be the most alone I&#8217;ve been in seven years.  We&#8217;ll have to see how that goes.</p>


	<p>Well, what do you think of that?  I&#8217;ll be in Richmond till 2005.  Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s an improvement.</p>
