<p>CompUSA (!!) has a <a href="http://www.cheapstingybargains.com/cheapster/2005/09/tivo_series2_40.html">40 hour TiVo unit for free</a> when you sign up for a one-year membership.  You hear people talk about TiVo all the time, but I am <strong>telling</strong> you, something like TiVo will change the way we all watch television.  TiVo has my strongest possible recommendation if you ever watch any TV.</p>


	<p>I might make a page and describe everything I do with TiVo in the next couple of days, but serious, for $12 a month over the next year, you shouldn&#8217;t need your arm twisted.</p>
