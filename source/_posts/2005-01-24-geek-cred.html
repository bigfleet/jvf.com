<p>Last week, I installed Apache 2 and Subversion from source tarballs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.  I&#8217;ve never managed to pull off anything even remotely that awesome.</p>


	<p>Since I&#8217;m not going to get my own special <span class="caps">RHEL</span> license just to run on VMWare, I&#8217;ve moved to a Fedora Core 3 installation.  I really feel like I&#8217;m starting to learn my way around Linux, which is nice.  It&#8217;s just the killer installation process aligning with the installed hardware!</p>
