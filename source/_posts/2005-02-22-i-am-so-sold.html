<p>In the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve put together a very simple Rails application that touches some of the functionality available.  A full write-up will come when I&#8217;m done with the project and can really do the tutorial right.  (I don&#8217;t want to be spreading misinformation!)</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s been 100% awesome.  I thought my first experience with <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> was impressive (and it was, for Java), but I&#8217;ve been blown away by how easy it is to do what I&#8217;m doing.</p>


	<p>In addition, the new <a title="scott.elitists.net" href="http://scott.elitists.net/view/17">Routing features in Rails</a> and the new <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/videos/clips/components.mov">&#8220;low-level&#8221; component</a> capabilities have me salivating.  I promise to take some time  very shortly to write up my impressions of Ruby at this stage.</p>
