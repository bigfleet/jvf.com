<p>I hit town and picked up my rental car.  This is only the second time I&#8217;ve ever rented a car, and the first one was because I backed my van into a pole while having a low-level nervous breakdown.  This time I got to feel like an adult.  Coming into town on business!  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/quotes">Our little baby&#8217;s all growns up</a> was all I could think.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I picked up a Accord LX for my mid-size deal.  Not bad, huh!  I did get a little miffed at Enterprise&#8217;s web system for not charging me the $10 a day for being 24 even though I told them that before.</p>


	<p>The bed over at the La Quinta Astrodome is probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I&#8217;ve ever slept in, if not the best.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve not even left yet and I&#8217;ve eaten at <a href="http://www.freebirds.com/">Freebird&#8217;s</a>, the Hobbit Hole&#8212;er, Cafe, Rudyard&#8217;s, Rucci&#8217;s, Two Rows (more on that in a moment)...  One thing you have to say about Houston is they have delicious restaurants.</p>


	<p>At Two Rows, where I was meeting with Jordan Faykus, we saw Jamie Sharper and Kailee Wong from the Texans (bringing back Madden &#8216;04 memories for me&#8230;.  mmmmmm) and  <a href="http://www.movieprop.com/tvandmovie/savedbythebell/acslater.htm">A.C. Slater</a> was with them.  Unbelievable!  Of course, his real name is Mario Lopez.  Who cares about that, though?</p>


	<p>I got to run around with Jordan Pearce the other night, and that was a lot of fun.  <a href="http://www.rudyards.com/">Rudz</a> for drinks, West Alabama Ice House for drinks (also featuring the first time I walked out on a tab&#8212;whoops!), Rol-In for drinks&#8230;  I think you&#8217;re getting the picture.  That&#8217;s how we ended up at Rucci&#8217;s at 2 AM, and thanks to my magical &#8220;water and pill&#8221; regime, no hangover for Sunday.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also gotten quite a bit of work done, creating a fairly complete master development plan for the 360 feedback project, and having a good requirements meeting on that very issue today.  Even so, though, getting reimbursed for the trip to just have that meeting seems like a big win for me.  I certainly have enjoyed it.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting a Chai tea and posting on my blog from a coffee shop now.  I mean, what next?  Getting a beret?  Starting a poetry notebook?</p>


	<p>About the only thing I&#8217;m feeling bad about is that I haven&#8217;t called Jennifer yet about Jess, but that&#8217;ll change soon, I&#8217;m sure.  But it&#8217;s been a happy conclusion to the holiday preliminaries.</p>
