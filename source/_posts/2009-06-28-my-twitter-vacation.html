It's been bizarre to see Twitter become so popular so quickly.  I love its versatility and how it's helped me do a lot of different things in my professional and personal life.  For no particular reason I decided to take a month off to see what I missed, what I didn't, and anything else I might have noticed.

<!--more--><h2>Things I missed.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tweeting my frustrations with "the way things are"</li>
<li>Questions my followers could help me with</li>
<li>Talking about what I was listening to</li>
<li>Complimenting <a href="http://twitter.com/blairblends">@blairblends</a> on his fab new avatar</li>
<li>Announcements of big achievements (I had two!)</li>
<li>Marking tweets as favorites.</li>
<li>Reading tweets from friends</li>
<li>Reading tweets from people who can teach me something I want to learn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things I did not miss</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The noise</strong></li>
<li>Being among the first to know about scandals or deaths</li>
<li>Green avatars</li>
<li>Reading tweets from people I am trying to keep tabs on</li>
</ul>


<h2>What Now?</h2>

I think it's time to focus a little bit more on the people who I like the most on Twitter.  This is going to mean unfollowing a lot of people I have been following for a long time.  It's going to mean unfollowing some people who follow me.  I'm OK with that.

I also felt like I had more creative energy for bigger projects.  I was surprised how much not tweeting meant for my "blog ideas" lists or ideas for my book.  I think I'll be moving toward just the occasional tweet during the day and doing most of my tweeting at night.

But overall, I found it an interesting experiment.  If Twitter is a big deal for you (and I imagine some of you reading this might fit that description), I recommend taking some time off and seeing what you learn.
