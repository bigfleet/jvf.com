<p>Here&#8217;s the listing text.  Punctuation and capitalization have not been changed to embarrass the guilty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is all true, except for the &#8220;quiet street&#8221; part.  It might not see a lot of car traffic, but it&#8217;s a very active portion of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a 4/2, with two large bedrooms upstairs.  We&#8217;re planning on having one be the master, and the other a den.  Megan floated the term &#8220;football room&#8221; during our original walkthrough, which she is living to regret.  On the ground floor will be a nice (but small) living room, a sizable kitchen that needs a little work, a guest room, and a study.</p>

<p>Everything is painted white, which is an improvement over the <strong>sponge painting on every wall</strong> that was in place when the sellers originally purchased the home.</p>

<p>The neighborhood has a pool and tennis courts.  One court is within walking distance from our place.  That will be a <em>welcome return</em>.  (Wow, how do people even put up with me?)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s in a really good school district, the roof will be fine for another decade, the appliances conveyed, and I&#8217;m very excited.</p>

<p>The sellers are going to be living there until near the end of the month.  That gives me time to round up my stuff here and get my apartment rented.  My lease required <em>90 days notice</em>, which is kind of outrageous, but my only requirement to get out of the lease is to find a new tenant.  Those are the projects now, getting packed and finding someone to come live in the nicest place I&#8217;ve ever called my own.</p>
