<p>Friendster shakes you up with four levels of friends, stirs, and lets settle.  It was originally started as a dating service (interestingly enough), but I think it&#8217;s kind of interesting to see from a purely network/information point of view.  You can also people watch without getting out of your chair.</p>


	<p>In short, go ahead and join.  Why not?  I should be registered with my bigfleet address, which will go out of commission shortly after a six year run.  That&#8217;s like 72 in Internet years.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve heard some people talk bad about it, including me.  The first time I logged on, I was like &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?&#8221;  It gets a lot more interesting as your membership becomes official and you add a couple of friend links.  I&#8217;m linked to twelve girls in Houston with three friends who (to my knowledge) have never even visited here.  Freaky stuff.</p>


	<p>One guy on one of my mailing lists said &#8220;It&#8217;s a popularity contest, just like high-school.&#8221;  Well, who cares?  Let them win.  I just want to see interesting stuff, and it certainly helped pass some time at work today.</p>
