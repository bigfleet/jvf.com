<p>My love for Fafblog! has no limits.</p>

<p><a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/another-bold-victory-in-war-on-people.html">Fafblog! the whole world's only source for Fafblog.</a>: "Were lives lost? Of course. Were cities razed, flesh burned with poison gas, families slaughtered and children raped? Naturally. But one can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, burning the crockery, setting the kitchen on fire, firebombing the restaurant and summarily executing the survivors."</p>
