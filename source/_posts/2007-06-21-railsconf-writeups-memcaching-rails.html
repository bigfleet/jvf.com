<p>This talk was a bit of a stretch for me, having never written an application that was even close to needing Memcached.  I had a great seat, though, and really enjoyed meeting Chris at the &#8220;Joyent Happy Hour&#8221;.  I also had just sat through a talk where all the concepts were familiar.  What was the worst that could happen?</p>


	<p>I ended up really enjoying the presentation for multiple reasons.  You can access his presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/err/kickin-ass-with-cachefu-without-notes/">here</a> and be sure to look around for the download option.  And get the version with notes!!!</p>


	<p>I loved the introduction which definitely made me feel like I might have been sitting there in that GameSpot booth with the same challenges.  (Although odds are good that I would have been watching the braniacs do the real work.)  He also didn&#8217;t set himself up as an expert, which I normally respond well to, especially if the speaker is obviously lying because he is in the middle of presenting at RailsConf.  I also really appreciated that he shared a mistake he made that brought down GameSpot.  Learning from others&#8217; mistakes is the best.</p>


	<p>The introduction to memcached couldn&#8217;t have been better, from my perspective.  I knew almost nothing about it, and learning very quickly about the basics was nice.  Everyone knows what a hash is like, and the presentation built appropriately from there.</p>


	<p>It takes balls to put a <span class="caps">YAGNI</span> slide 25 slides into your presentation&#8230; <strong>about your presentation itself!</strong></p>


	<p>The cache_fu plugin appears to be one of my favorite sort of plugins, the sort that does a lot of assembly and simplifying of other work.  The code was never that hard to grasp and his presentation is still available as a starting place.</p>


	<p>This presentation also sounded another note about using mocks and stubs.  Gotta look into getting more hands-on experience there.  Check out slide 70 for goodness sakes, although that&#8217;s not a result of mocha or stubba.</p>


	<p>The biggest take home for me is <strong>it&#8217;s OK to make mistakes</strong>.  It happens all the time.  The problem is not being able to react because you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.  That&#8217;s why you can listen to the front-runners and make sure that you do it as right as you can the first time out.</p>
