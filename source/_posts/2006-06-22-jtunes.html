<h2>Intake</h2>


	<h3>The Albums</h3>


	<p>I finally justified the purchase of one of those <a href="http://digitalinnovations.com/">Skip Dr.</a> type inventions that restores discs that are not playing correctly.  I&#8217;ve heard any number of things about &#8220;home remedies&#8221; that will do just the same thing.  I have tried a few, and none of them worked.  Toothpaste was a notable failure.  My Spin Dr. was (and is) awesome.  It cleaned over 250 CD&#8217;s, I&#8217;m sure.  If you&#8217;ve already spent a good deal of money on your music collection, you should probably get one.  It&#8217;s an extremely low-grade belt sander, but with sufficient lubrication, it has worked flawlessly.</p>


	<h3>The Live Shows</h3>


	<p>All my live shows are in some lossless format already, although <span class="caps">SHN</span> is probably  my least favorite music format of all time.  Conversion to <span class="caps">FLAC</span> will be part of the project.  Also, I&#8217;ll be using the tailor-made <a href="http://etree-scripts.sourceforge.net/">etree-scripts</a> to do a few different things.  I&#8217;ve already used it to successfully transcode a few of my favorite shows, and it&#8217;s a perfect command-line interface to the process.  Hooray!</p>

	<h3>Synchronization</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m no judge of precisely how Type <span class="caps">A I</span> am overall&#8212;(my guess is not very), but there are some things that I am absolutely compulsive about.</p>


	<p>I am sick of spending a good deal of time editing metadata to get it <strong>exactly</strong> the way I like, and then either some other external program overwrites it, or I have to switch formats or something.  Part of the synchronization process will notice that a file has changed and see if it needs to update the metadata on the lossy image.  Robin Bowes&#8217; <a href="http://robinbowes.com/projects/flac2mp3">flac2mp3 script</a> is doing a fantastic job already.</p>


	<h3>Genre classification</h3>


	<p>I am also sick of having some random, proprietary genre structure that I don&#8217;t agree with most of the time anyway.  <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">AllMusic</a> has something that I&#8217;ll agree with, usually.  This element of the project hasn&#8217;t really begun.</p>


	<h3>Playlist magic</h3>


	<p>Once all files and genres are known, there&#8217;s nothing about <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">amarok</a> that would prevent me from getting playlist data out of it.  From there, I can create my own playlist magic, if I&#8217;m unsatisfied with what I get for free.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t know for a fact if I can get ratings I drop on my iPod to transfer over, but I&#8217;ll let you know if I come up with anything.</p>


	<h2>The Pimp Sh!t</h2>


	<h3>Sharing At Home</h3>


	<p>All capable computers will serve the lossless files to perserve audio quality, where possible.  Everywhere else will <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2006/06/11/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-drop-the-ogg">use the <span class="caps">MP3</span> image</a></p>


	<h3> Sharing With Friends</h3>


	<p>I would never do this, right?  That would be <strong>illegal</strong>.  Or rather, it wouldn&#8217;t be illegal, exactly, but I could get <strong>sued</strong>.  Even though <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/services/2006-06-12-riaa_x.htm?csp=34">they have everything under control</a></p>


	<h3> Streaming Content</h3>


	<p>In combination with a bit more technical wizardry, it would be entirely possible for me to run my own Internet radio station that I could listen to during the day, changing directions according to my every whim.</p>


	<h2>Conclusion</h2>


	<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m pumped.</p>
