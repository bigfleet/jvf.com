<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m still kicking it.</p>


	<p>The move is over, more or less.  I now live in <a href="http://www.fandistrict.org/">The Fan</a> in Richmond, VA.  It&#8217;s really very nice.  There&#8217;s folks of all ages, but everybody&#8217;s personable.  I live less then two blocks from three different restaurants, all of them good.  All of them are also bars.  It&#8217;s that kind of place.</p>


	<p>I live in a very old house, it&#8217;ll be 100 next year.  That has its own quirks, but mostly it&#8217;s a nice change of pace from the sterile Brompton Court apartments.  I am the closest to a laundry room I&#8217;ve ever been.  No dishwasher, though.  With the amount of cooking I do, however, that&#8217;s not a huge sacrifice.</p>


	<p>My project has been running for almost a week with no real hiccups.  That&#8217;s pretty gratifying.</p>


	<p>My friendship with Elizabeth is turning into something a little new for me, not that it&#8217;s any of your business.  ;-)</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting ready to visit Brady this weekend down in South Carolina.  That&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun.</p>


	<p>Mostly, I&#8217;m hoping to start writing more frequently.  Not the first time you&#8217;ve heard me say that, though, right?</p>
