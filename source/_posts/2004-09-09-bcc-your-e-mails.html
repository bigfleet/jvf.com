<p>I don&#8217;t care how unit tested your code is, end users will complain that they didn&#8217;t get the e-mail.  It&#8217;s then your responsibilty to prove that the e-mail was sent.  You can&#8217;t rely on your users choosing to configure their system to e-mail the designers.  Create some address whose sole resposibility is a mail archive and where delivery will be nearly guaranteed.</p>
