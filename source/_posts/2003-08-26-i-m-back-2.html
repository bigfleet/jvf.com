<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Vacation is over.</strong></font></dt>
<dd> I read all the books I left with over that week.  The brain is getting pretty limber!  Already posted is the review of the book I read before the break.  I&#8217;ll hope to have one more up every night till they&#8217;re all up.  It was very enlightening, although I finally read some books that I didn&#8217;t think were that great.  Virginia Beach itself seemed pretty average.  The family&#8217;s doing pretty well, although it&#8217;s a time of big flux still.  It&#8217;s tough to gauge everyone when I spend so much time away.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><strong>The Me Sale</strong></font></dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m trying to get rid of a lot of my stuff to keep from having to move it.  I&#8217;m tired of being so heavyweight.  I posted two notices about the stuff I was selling, and now two items remain less than 24 hours later.  If this keeps up, I&#8217;ll be more than ready to go when the movers show up, maybe before my dad shows up.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><strong>Classes Start and I&#8217;m Not There</strong></font></dt>
<dd>To be on Rice campus without feeling excited about classes starting is very strange.  The fact that I&#8217;m excited to be leaving is even stranger.  I&#8217;m actually kind of getting a thrill about having my own responsibilities on campus draw to a close.</dd>
