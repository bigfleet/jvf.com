<p>Here&#8217;s a set of updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>This month does deal with some nasty financial crap.  I have a new financial planner, and I&#8217;m trying to get my taxes done this month as well.</li>
<li>The goal for this year is to be more financially literate.  I&#8217;ve read three of the <a href="http://www.richdad.com/">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a> books;  those books have been the inspiration to study up.</li>
<li>As a result of that, I&#8217;m learning about investing in real estate.  In conjunction with reading The Worldly Philosophers by some dude whose last name begins with H, it&#8217;s impossible to ignore the fact that shelter is the means by which the poor make the rich better off.</li>
<li>So, naturally, I&#8217;m trying to get myself in on some property.</li>
<li>Having nothing to do with the above, Megan and I are looking at houses.  We&#8217;ve had one bubble to the top <i>kind of</i> disconcertingly early, considering that our leases aren&#8217;t up until June 1.  Also, if you personally are considering buying a house sometime soon, <em><span class="caps">PLEASE</span></em> start getting educated now.  There is a lot to learn, and no single mentor will be willing to teach you all that you should know to defend your own interests.</li>
<li>Work is still going well.  They may hire me, they may not.  I&#8217;m doing absolutely killer work, so I honestly don&#8217;t care.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m worried about Elizabeth&#8212;not my sister, but my friend.  I need to get some time next week to go up and see her.</li>
<li>I have <strong>not</strong> been drinking.  I promise.</li>
</ul>
