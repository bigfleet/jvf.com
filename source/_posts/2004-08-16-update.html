<p>I&#8217;m doing the transition of employers this month, which means two jobs.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not getting much time to post.  Look for more in September.</p>


	<p>In terms of my projects, I am moving along my integration of <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/salmon"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a>, <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>, and <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a>.  I&#8217;m finishing up work on the persistence layer, then I&#8217;ll be moving on to the front end construction.</p>
