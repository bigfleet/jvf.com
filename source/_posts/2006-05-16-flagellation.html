<p>My longest absence ever from the blog, more than a month and a half.  I can only say that I was needed elsewhere.  I&#8217;ve been reminded recently about how I used to post about the smallest things, like the fact that it&#8217;s so much easier to appreciate Lennox Lewis&#8217;s career now that the heavyweight division is horrible.  But these thoughts wither and die as I&#8217;m on my way from one place to another and I just haven&#8217;t gotten them up.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one cares anyway.  But, anyway, at least the drought is over now.</p>
