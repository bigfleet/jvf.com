<p>The request for the wardrobe came about when I discovered that I had two shirts that were the same.  Exactly the same.  And I had been wearing them for months, without even realizing.  Unforgivable!  &#8220;When did this happen?&#8221; I thought.  Booney would never have let something like that happen on her watch.</p>


	<p>Anyway, the new threads are mostly from <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com/eb/default.asp">Eddie Bauer</a>.  I&#8217;ve gotten many clothes from them over the years, mostly because they have a wide selection in Tall.  (Also, when did Structure turn into Express Men and <a href="http://www.expressfashion.com/style/must_haves/tops_m.jsp?navid=1.2.2.1.0.0">start to suck</a>?  How come they didn&#8217;t run it by me?)</p>


	<p>Anyway, the content is mostly long-sleeve woven button-downs, suitable for dress or casual.  It reminds me of Faykus&#8217;s wardrobe, only maybe with more stripes&#8212;and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen him wear any sweaters.  Not that any of you have seen <strong>me</strong> wear more than one or two maybe.  But now I have some very nice ones that are actually appealing to wear.  I actually like the idea, since apparently the idea of what a &#8220;sweater&#8221; is has changed since I was eight, and had to wear them to church.  They&#8217;re a lot thinner!</p>


	<p>A lot of accessories, too.  New pairs of comfortable dress shoes, gloves, sunglasses, etc.  I can appreciate anything that makes me feel a bit like I&#8217;m a new person.  Even though it&#8217;s plainly obvious to everyone, I sometimes forget.</p>


	<p>The knives are from J.A. Henckel.  Erin&#8217;s mom took back the ones she bought for her&#8212;who could blame her!  I survived my semester in the one-bedroom down on Brompton with just a utility knife.  Have you ever cut bread with a utility knife?  Not pretty.  So anyway, score that one for the new place&#8212;whenever <strong>that</strong> happens.  We&#8217;re having enough problems just getting the basement finished.</p>


	<p>Christmas Eve netted me some neat books, including some which you&#8217;ll sure to see reviewed here shortly.  Free time has been a lot harder to come by, lately.  I did get some <span class="caps">DVD</span>&#8217;s as well, like Simpson&#8217;s Third Season (classic) and Family Guy third season (I didn&#8217;t even have the first two&#8212;what gives, Ib?)</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s all for this post!</p>
