<p>Especially interesting is this.</p>
<blockquote>
At Quantico Marine Air Base, in a special ceremony designed to win congressional support, an Osprey was supposed to roar over the airfield like a military jet, then dramatically drop to the tarmac in helicopter mode. But as members of Congress and government officials watched, the aircraft&#8217;s right engine caught fire. The plane plunged 500 feet into the Potomac River, killing all seven marines aboard. The program was grounded for 11 months.
