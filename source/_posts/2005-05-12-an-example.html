<p>I am going absolutely crazy reading blogs and adding to my <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks.  Here&#8217;s an example of one of the good things I&#8217;ve come across.  The conjecture is that <a title="Josh Kaufman: Inside My Bald Head: The Josh Kaufman "Personal MBA" Program (Updated 3/19/2005)" href="http://www.joshkaufman.net/archives/2005/03/the_josh_kaufma.html">you can get the equivalent of an <span class="caps">MBA</span> education by reading books.</a></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s not as much value, obviously, but it&#8217;s a lot cheaper.  By the way, these are the books I&#8217;m devouring these days.</p>
