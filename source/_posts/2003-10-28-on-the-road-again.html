<p>Last week, it was the <span class="caps">CISV</span> National Board Meeting.  It&#8217;s the least I&#8217;ve had to do leaving an <span class="caps">NBM</span> since I was a JB president ten years ago.  This coming weekend, I&#8217;m headed to Knoxville!  I&#8217;ll be checking in on Jess, and accompanying my sister, who&#8217;ll be meeting her friends.  It&#8217;ll be so welcome to be able to make the trip in one day, and I&#8217;m happy to make Ib&#8217;s drive only a few hours instead of two full days.  I do like it behind the wheel&#8230;</p>
