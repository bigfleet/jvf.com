<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/mattwaltersnet/~3/137629528/">Matt</a> tagged me, and this seems like a decent enough way to catch everyone up with the basics of what&#8217;s going on at this extremely busy time in my life.</p>


	<p>&#8220;list eight habits or facts about yourself, then tag eight more people.&#8221;</p>


<ol>
<li>I am not going to finish up writing RailsConf 2007 like I said that I would.  I blame my readers for their utter lack of caring.  It&#8217;s just too far in the rear-view mirror now.  Next year, I&#8217;ll move more quickly.</li>
<li>I left on a trip for Europe on July 16 and returned on July 30.  It was an incredible trip, undoubtedly one I will remember for a long time.  The trip was with 10 high-school children from King William county where Megan taught this year.  I&#8217;m certainly going to try to blog about this.</li>
<li>The time between RailsConf and Europe was spent primarily on <span class="caps">XSLT</span> project with a Flash front-end.  That was different.</li>
<li>Two days after I came back to work, I was laid off by my employer.  It was four days before my ten-year high school reunion, and just over two weeks before <strong>The Big Day</strong>.  I&#8217;m interviewing with several places around the country, and having an enjoyable time considering the possibilities.  I am looking outside the Richmond area, and if you know of a senior level Ruby/Rails position with some managerial responsibilities, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</li>
<li>I attended my ten year high school reunion, and I would describe it as surreal and anticlimactic.  I expected to know more of the people who came.</li>
<li>I get married in less than ten days.</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> habitually, even though there&#8217;s really no point to doing so.</li>
<li>I tend to be a very calm person typically, but if I am hungry, that is a dangerous time to irk me.</li>
</ol>

	<p>I&#8217;m not going to tag anyone, you can do this if you want.</p>
