<dt>Football</dt>
<dd><p>I&#8217;m 8-0 straight up in the playoffs, so far.  That&#8217;s intriguing, but I have absolutely no idea who will win the Super Bowl.  I&#8217;m picking the Eagles and the Pats to advance to Houston, but I absolutely cannot pick that game.  Should be fun to watch, though!</p></dd>
<dt>The Job</dt>
<dd><p>I wanted to put together a good week on the software development project.  This was the first time I was putting together real pages that are going to be used in the project using <a href="http://www.salmonllc.com/"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span></a> and <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>.</p>
<p>I was on fire.  Everything I tried worked, more or less after the first compile.  The pages fell and I was able to get one day ahead of the best-case scenario I laid out for myself.  I already gave that day up to work on the actual consulting gig a little.</p>
<p>I also got exposed to <a href="http://www.httpunit.com">HttpUnit</a>, a unit testing framework for web applications.  The JUnit framework doesn&#8217;t exactly to wrap your tests around the pages in the right way, but HttpUnit fits just right.  It&#8217;s easily integrated, uses an <span class="caps">API</span>, and looks like it behaves the way you want.  It&#8217;ll be a big time saver for me if it works out.</p>
<p>Last thing about work&#8212;if I ever get a chance to fully work out what exactly I need from <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> to make it play exactly how I want, then I will be able to <span class="caps">REALLY</span> cook.  <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> integrates about halfway with Hibernate, and if the other half ever falls, that will really be something.  I know it&#8217;s within my reach, but I think I&#8217;ll really try to target any new additions for a 2.0 release, rather than doing such <strong>huge</strong> refactoring in the middle of this project.</p></dd>
<dt>The Plan</dt>
<dd><p>I got my behavior modification spreadsheet all worked out, and today was the first day.  I plan on sharing the highlights of the results every week, so  I&#8217;m at the very least not to have those stretches where nothing even shows up on the page.</p></dd>
<dt>Mission Accomplished</dt>
<dd><p>I got to talk to Brady in the middle of the week.  It was really great, but it did make me realize how lonely I&#8217;ve gotten up here.  Football is too interesting to skip it now, but it will be interesting when I get my weekends completely freed up.  Am I going to do anything about it?  Will anything that I do about it actually work?  Who knows?</p></dd>
