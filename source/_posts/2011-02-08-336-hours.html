In the next two weeks, I expect the following events:
<ul>
	<li>I will speak at <a href="http://ignitecharlotte.org">Ignite! Charlotte</a> for a second time, this time in front of a sold-out Neighborhood Theater.</li>
	<li>My wife Megan and I will have a pre-natal visit and our last ultrasound before the birth of our first child, a son, in April.</li>
	<li>My wife's parents will make their first visit to Charlotte, bringing their dogs with them.  We will have ten living creatures in the house.</li>
	<li>I will turn 32.</li>
	<li>My wife will have a baby shower.</li>
	<li>My parents will visit with the intention of selecting a new home for themselves, here in Charlotte. Â After that selection, I expect the logistics of their move to be made in a short amount of time.</li>
	<li>I will attend a meeting of <a href="http://www.techexeccouncil.org/">CRTEC</a> which promises to become the home of Charlotte's technology leadership, followed by a meeting with another CRTEC member to discuss our vision of Charlotte's software development community.</li>
	<li>I will attend an all-day workshop for entrepreneurs focused on preparing for investment and attracting investors to small businesses, put on by the <a href="http://www.bigcouncil.com/">BIG council</a> in conjunction with the SBTDC.</li>
	<li>I will submit a talk for RailsConf 2011.</li>
	<li>Megan and I will attend a Punch Brothers show at the Neighborhood Theater.  Chris Eldridge is a dear friend of Megan's.</li>
	<li>I will celebrate the one year anniversary of going freelance with <a href="http://itsbspoke.com">it's bspoke</a>.</li>
	<li>Adam Howell and I will observe the one year anniversary of <a href="http://workmontage.com">Work Montage</a> and our product <a href="http://mocksup.com">Mocksup</a>.</li>
	<li>And finally, although a more formal announcement will be forthcoming, I've altered bspoke's charter to accept a full-time CTO position at <a href="http://otherscreen.com">Otherscreen</a>, a web and mobile startup here in Charlotte, NC.  It is a true privilege to be working with this team already, and you should expect big things.</li>
</ul>
That's in addition to client work and the particulars of every day life.  If I am overly quiet or missing for a good portion of February, now you know why.  If I owe you something, please keep reminding me.  Except for you, Raquel, I'm almost done with your recommendation.
