<p>I started using the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/">Omea News Reader</a> from JetBrains today, and I really liked how easy it was to process <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet/blogroll?setcount=100">my blogroll</a> into a useable form.  I&#8217;ll keep you updated if there is better software for Windows, but this will definitely do for now!  I like it quite a bit.</p>
