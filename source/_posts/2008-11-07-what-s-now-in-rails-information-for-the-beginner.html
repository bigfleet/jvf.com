<h2>The Question</h2>


	<blockquote>
		<p>What the latest/greatest sources of information/tutorials/gadgets for RoR is.  Sure I can Google, but I&#8217;d like to get recommendations from the source.  Maybe you have Delicious tags, dunno?</p>

	<p><cite style="float:right;margin-right:10%"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peter_braswell">@peter_braswell</a></cite></p>


	<h2>Twitter</h2>


	<p>The Rails community does actually say what they&#8217;re up to.  The RubyLearning blog recently complied a list of the <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/10/29/50-rubyists-to-follow-on-twitter/">top Rubyist Twitter personalities</a>.  This is a good way to be on the cutting edge without actually doing anything.  It can also help you engage directly with those who can help the most.</p>


	<h2>The Aggregators</h2>


	<p>Peter Cooper (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterc">@peterc</a>) runs <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">Ruby Inside</a> and <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/">Rails Inside</a> which aggregate and comment on a lot of what&#8217;s happening in the community.  Follow those and start from there to build a respectable blog roll.</p>


	<h2>Rails Core</h2>


	<p>Recently the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/">official Rails blog</a> has really stepped forward, but in quantity and quality of posts.  It&#8217;s also, of course, a canonical source for information.  Gregg Pollack&#8217;s &#8220;This Week in Rails&#8221; posts are a highlight, of course along with <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/">the original &#8216;What&#8217;s New in Edge Rails&#8217; series from a core contributor</a>.</p>


	<h2>Themes in Modern Rails</h2>


	<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>


	<p>A lot of successful companies that are using Rails have arrived at their success through a consultancy approach that focuses on green-field applications.  While Rails certainly <strong>can</strong> be used with legacy applications, it&#8217;s not really a secret that writing new applications is the bread and butter for Rails.  As a result, more and more bootstrapping supplements are available at the beginning of projects.  These have an aim of providing useful tools, or adding a few additional opinions to add to the pile of opinions Rails has about how you ought to be writing your apps.</p>


	<p>My understanding is that <a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">Bort</a> was one of the elements allowed during the recent <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble</a>.  <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a>, a respected consultancy that is <strong>absolutely killing it</strong> with their <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects">open source contributions</a>, offers <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/10/21/suspenders">suspenders</a>, which they use at the beginning of all their projects.  Others are also available, but these seem of particular importance.</p>


	<p>I personally have never used any of them, because I seemingly never start new projects.  They certainly may be of interest to those at the &#8220;Hello World&#8221; level today.</p>


	<h3>Git and GitHub</h3>


	<p><img src="http://images.nymag.com/images/2/news/07/05/week1/studio54/studio070507_1_600B.jpg" style="width:50%;float:right;padding:0px 0px 10px 10px;" alt="" /></p>


	<p>If <strong>any</strong> method for hosting your source code were <strong>ever</strong> to be compared to Studio 54, <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> would have to be it.  The process of hosting, contributing, documenting, and using <del>drugs</del> open source has never been easier.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/languages">en vogue among Rubyists</a> and you and your projects will be better of by learning and using Git.  (Protips available from <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, an outstanding source for info in its own right.)</p>


	<p>Git is a complete re-imagining of source control.  It&#8217;s not like the transition from <span class="caps">CVS</span> to <span class="caps">SVN</span>.  There are a lot more concepts to learn, and with more power comes more responsibility.  As my familiarity with git has grown, I am sure that I will never go back to Subversion.</p>


	<p>The fact that GitHub is so popular, with such an incredibly active and present ecosystem of open-source tools is just another layer of awesome on top. It looks like it might have been <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/3/2/migration-concordance">Josh Susser</a> who said that &#8220;GitHub is social networking for geeks.&#8221;</p>


	<h3>RailsCasts</h3>


	<p>In addition to the aforementioned <a href="http://www.peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>, there are a few additional sources for screencasts.  I personally have most of those screencasts, and have never been disappointed.</p>


	<p><a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts">The Pragmatic Programmers screencasts</a> and the <a href="http://envycasts.com/">EnvyCast</a> series are also good.</p>


	<p>Although they deal with topics that aren&#8217;t always for beginners, the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> series is not to be missed.  Ryan Bates does a great job with consistently turning out quality work, and RailsCasts are free.</p>


	<h3>Delicious</h3>


	<p>I do occasionally tag <a href="http://delicious.com/bigfleet/rails">Rails</a> and <a href="http://delicious.com/bigfleet/ruby">Ruby</a> items of interest to me.  <span class="caps">YMMV</span>.</p>
