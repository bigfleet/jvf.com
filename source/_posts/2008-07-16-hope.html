<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with <a href="/2008/3/22/the-boring-one-about-my-leg">my health problems with my leg</a>, this may come as a surprise.</p>


	<p>I had surgery a week ago, on Wednesday morning.  You can see a description of <a href="http://totalspine.com/Minimally-Invasive-Surgery/Lumbar-Micro-Endo.asp">lumbar micro-discectomy</a> at my doctors&#8217; site.</p>


	<p>I was nervous leading up to the incident, especially after finding out that I would be intubated, but that&#8217;s in the rear view mirror now.  After they put the IV in, I remember a few more discussions and then them leaving me in a hall for a second.  Next thing I remember was waking up after the procedure in the recovery room and asking for some water.</p>


	<p>In terms of the pain that has been a part of my life for so long, that particular kind of pain is gone.  I am healing from surgery, and that&#8217;s never going to be a ride at Carowinds, but there&#8217;s no comparison between them.  I am so fortunate to come across excellent doctors and <a href="http://www.presbyterian.org/">an exceptional hospital in Charlotte</a></p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way from that pretty helpless first 24 hours after the surgery, but there&#8217;s still always to go on the recovery process.  I did have enough strength to run some errands yesterday afternoon, but
I am on a very strict schedule for how long I can sit up straight.  I even have what&#8217;s basically a perfect assistant there, having picked up <a href="http://www.embraceware.com/software/awaken/">Awaken</a> during one of the last Mac software blowouts.  I also have to wear these ridiculous tights for some kind of circulation issue in my legs.  Don&#8217;t expect pictures.</p>


	<p>My mother has been in town helping the recovery process, and she leaves in a few hours.  I know both Megan and I have found her presence invaluable.  It will be hard to say goodbye this time.</p>


	<p>To sum up, I am still not fully independent (try keeping track of how often you bend at the waist today) but I am sure that day will come soon.  That will be welcome.</p>
