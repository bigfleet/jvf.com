<p>Here&#8217;s a story about the gigantic <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=528&#38;e=2&#38;u=/ap/20040327/ap_on_hi_te/linux_vs__windows">Microsoft fine</a> and what it means to Linux.  One thing to remember as you read these stories;  Linux is free.  It has no shareholders, really.  It has no costs.  It&#8217;s not going anywhere but up.  Ground it gains in the battle it will never lose, because it is <strong>free</strong>, and people like that.</p>
