<p>Perhaps one day I&#8217;ll be able to check <a title="Cocoa: Java/Objective-C Language Integration" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LanguageIntegration/index.html">this</a> out.  I have written quite a few tiny programs for myself in the past, and it&#8217;d be so nice for them to look pretty!</p>
