<p>I just realized that I got the old Milton treatment.  I&#8217;ve been moved from the office I was working in, which was average, to the lab.  It&#8217;s huge, but imagine a room that&#8217;s no one&#8217;s responsibility that a bunch of comps have access to.</p>


<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a total mess.  Trash on top of boxes on top of monitors</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll have to bring the minidisc with me every day.  There&#8217;s about ten servers in here, so it&#8217;s like someone sitting next to me, whistling.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve got about as much room as an airline passenger at my desk.</li>
</ol>

	<p>There&#8217;s a typewriter in here, which is a fun throwback, but this is going to hamper my productivity today.  I think I&#8217;ll go play a game or shop or something in protest.</p>
