<p>At the end of January 2007, I made a list of my goals for what I wanted to accomplish before my 29th birthday in February of 2008.  There&#8217;s been so much change already that I think it&#8217;s OK to revisit this list in light of the first moments of 2008 being upon us.</p>


	<h3>Goals for the Blog</h3>


	<h4>Short term: Get the blog <span class="caps">URL</span> structure cemented as best as possible.</h4>


	<p>I am satisfied with what I got done here.  Without belaboring the point for those who don&#8217;t care too much, my goal was to get to a place where I would feel comfortable with Google no longer ignoring me.</p>


	<h4>Mid term: Get designer for personal site</h4>


	<p>I actually contacted someone who was willing to barter me some design skills for general technical excellence, but she backed out.  Oh, well!  I just picked a theme from the gallery as a result.</p>


	<h4>Year end: Have one two-word #1 Google result</h4>


	<p>I did accomplish this briefly&#8212;now appending &#8220;jimvanfleet&#8221; to the same query <span class="caps">STILL</span> doesn&#8217;t even get me first result.  Google, you&#8217;re so shifty!  I am going to change the form of this goal for next year to just encourage myself to create quality content.  Anyone familiar with this blog should realize that&#8217;s a major challenge for me. <img src="http://someguysblog.com/assets/2007/12/31/google-opensolaris-experience.png" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>Goals for <span class="caps">CISV USA</span></h3>


	<h4>Short term: Get the <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/"><span class="caps">CISV USA</span> webpage</a> moved to the new design</h4>


	<p>I am currently demoing a beta of another multiple-site <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a> installation to allow some chapters to have their home pages there.  This one is a success.</p>


	<h4>Mid term:  Get someone to help with mail administration</h4>


	<p>Total failure here.  Everyone I know is overqualified, and no one else has shown enough interest.</p>


	<h4>Year end:  Get one group using the wiki actively.</h4>


	<p>Still time on this one!  One more <span class="caps">EEC</span> retreat before my birthday, but I doubt it&#8217;ll work.</p>


	<h3>Goals for <span class="caps">CVREG</span></h3>


	<h4>Short term:  Complete what
