<p>Today is the one year anniversary of my first date with <a href="http://okcupid.com/profile?tuid=9496595302755694323">Megan Epp</a>.</p>


	<p>I realize that I haven&#8217;t posted very much here about Megan, but that hasn&#8217;t been because she&#8217;s not very important to me.  Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>


	<p>I met Megan online at <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/">OKCupid</a> which is an absolutely fantastic site.  Another of Megan&#8217;s friends met her boyfriend through OKCupid, and now both couples are living together.</p>


	<p>Megan and I were friends for several months before I worked up the courage to ask her out.  I planned and planned, because it was very important to me that no matter whether she wanted to go out with me or not, that we remained friends.  I can have difficulty making new friends, as it often takes me a little while to warm up to a new locale, and I knew from the first time we met at <a href="http://richmond.citysearch.com/review/10551048">World Cup</a> that she would be a good friend.</p>


	<p>Since we started dating, we haven&#8217;t spent very much time apart voluntarily.  That&#8217;s what makes it so hard to write about her!  She&#8217;s always looking over my shoulder!  (I&#8217;m just kidding, baby.)</p>


	<p>Megan and I formed a trusting relationship very quickly, and she&#8217;s been more understanding of my mental state than I ever could have expected.</p>


	<p>Living together hasn&#8217;t made us any more angry at each other, but we do have to watch our tendencies to buy <strong>cool stuff</strong> including Megan&#8217;s beloved shoe collection.</p>


	<p>She has an incredible ability to pick me up when I am down, and to calm me down when I am nervous or upset.  She challenges me to be my best, and <strong>lord knows</strong> I can&#8217;t get away with anything around her.</p>


	<p>She&#8217;s all I could ever ask for.  I just wanted to let you all know that.</p>
