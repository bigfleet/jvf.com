<p>With two episodes left, I was pretty convinced that Berserk was headed towards joining <a href="http://www.jimvanfleet.com/blog/archives/000003.php">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> as my favorite anime ever.  The real difference was that I enjoyed Evangelion&#8217;s &#8220;from left field&#8221; ending, (ignoring End of Evangelion), but didn&#8217;t enjoy Berserk&#8217;s.  What can you do?</p>


	<p>Briefly, Berserk really has three main characters.  For some reason, you only see Gatts mentioned, I have no idea why.  Gatts is a swordsman with an absolutely gigantic sword.  After the first episode, you might think this is going to be along the lines of Ninja Scroll, watching bad-asses just do their thing.  Fortunately, it&#8217;s a lot better than that.</p>


	<p>The other two leads are Griffith and Caska.  Griffith leads a group called &#8220;The Band of the Hawk,&#8221; and Caska is a captain.  Oh, yeah, she&#8217;s also a woman.  These three get stirred together as Gatts gets recruited and Griffith is climbing the charts towards what looks like becoming royalty after being born chattle.</p>


	<p>You&#8217;re in for some musings about destiny, and what your dreams and plans for your life are all about.  The personal drama in the middle and end I found very compelling.  The stage was perfectly set for a home-run ending, but suddenly, you find yourself in what seems like another series altogether.  I&#8217;m not going to say much about it besides even though it didn&#8217;t live up to my expectations, it didn&#8217;t altogether disappoint.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to give it a <strong>8.9/10</strong>, and tell you to watch it if you have Netflix.</p>
