<p>It&#8217;s been sort of a rough week, even though I&#8217;ve been enjoying myself in general.  My dad&#8217;s job at Capital One was eliminated, so now I&#8217;m preparing a &#8220;Can Web 2.0 get my dad a job?&#8221; blog post.</p>


	<p>I needed a new set of tires, which I got yesterday.  This was precipitated by having to change my spare at a gas station and <em>almost</em> doing it correctly.</p>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t do a Top 54 post on Friday, so I&#8217;m now 2 of 4 on that score.</p>


	<p>My fantasy teams did fantastically.  I will retain first place in my <span class="caps">ESPN</span> keeper league, be a solid playoff contender in all my leagues, and am ready to break into top 50 for fans of the teams I like in my college football Pick-&#8217;em and salary cap football league.</p>


	<p>And <span class="caps">UVA</span> beat <span class="caps">FSU</span>.  So the minuses are big, but we&#8217;ll get through them.</p>
