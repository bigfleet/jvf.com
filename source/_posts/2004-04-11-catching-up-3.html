<ul>
<li>I just started a <a href="http://devblog.jimvanfleet.com">blog about my job</a>, so if you&#8217;re into boredom you can check that out.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m nearing completion on my project.  It&#8217;s my hope that in the next couple of weeks I can really begin a personal life, including talking to you guys more.  Of course, there&#8217;s really not been too much to talk about&#8212;I&#8217;m watching movies and sports, thrilling, huh?</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to another conference in Reston next month.  I&#8217;m spending almost a grand to learn stuff.  Weird, huh?  I don&#8217;t even doubt that I&#8217;ll get my money&#8217;s worth from it, though.</li>
<li><strong>Matchstick Men</strong> is a good movie</li>
<li><strong>Deadwood</strong> is a good series.</li>
</ul>
