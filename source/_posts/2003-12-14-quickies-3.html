<ul>
<li>I just tonight started feeling fully better from my <span class="caps">NYC</span> illness.  Sorry if I&#8217;ve been tardy with e-mails and the like.  I&#8217;ll catch up very soon.</li>
<li>The job is going OK.  It looks like it&#8217;ll take me to Houston next week.  It should be interesting to get back to town&#8212;and I&#8217;ll love seeing Freebird&#8217;s again!  If you&#8217;re from there, expect to hear from me soon enough.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s raining ice here.  It sounds so odd.</li>
<li>Christmas looks like clothes this year.  That could be worse.</li>
</ul>
