<p>I was watching the 2004 World Series of Poker last night, and they had a bio on <a href="http://www.cardplayer.com/poker_tournaments/results.php?event_id=205&#38;writeup=1">Joe Awada</a>, a player born in Lebanon who emigrated here.</p>


	<p>When he got to the states, he didn&#8217;t have any money, and was touring with a circus doing shlep work.  All while he was working there, he practiced juggling.  Eventually, he signed a contract with another circus that got him to Vegas.</p>


	<p>So you think, &#8220;Oh, wow, then he learns how to gamble and makes it big!&#8221;  Not quite.  He ends up being a dealer and then <a href="http://www.dicedealer.com/3-5-7_poker.htm">developing a new style of poker</a>.  Apparently, that gives him the bankroll to then compete and win.</p>


	<p>Unreal!</p>
