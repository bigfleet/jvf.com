	<li>I&#8217;ve had to start tagging random horribleness on the net from the <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet/riaa"><span class="caps">RIAA</span></a> in addition to <a href="http://del.icio.us/bigfleet/bush">George Bush</a>.  <strong><span class="caps">AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH</span></strong>!</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/06/now_whos_a_bigg.html">Jerk/Genius</a> ratio for the Van Fleet family is astronomical, at just under 13 (11,400 to about 900).  The ratio for myself personally is closer to 3 (23/7), but none of them are referring to anyone named Jim Van Fleet actually being a jerk.</li>
