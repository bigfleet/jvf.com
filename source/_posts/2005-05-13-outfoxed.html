<p>If you are using FireFox, I urge you to <a href="http://getoutfoxed.com/referral.php?refererURI=http://getoutfoxed.com/users/bigfleet&#38;refererName=bigfleet">accept my invitation</a> to <a href="http://getoutfoxed.com">OutFoxed</a>.  It&#8217;s like <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but much better.  It&#8217;s a true chance to collaborate with friends and those you may be acquanted with while visiting web pages.  It&#8217;s a little bumpy right now, but I guarantee you that I&#8217;ll be using it.</p>
