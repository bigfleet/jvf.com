<p>Calling people is taking absolutely <strong>forever</strong>, so for those who haven&#8217;t heard yet. Megan and I got engaged.  It&#8217;s getting to be so long since it happened that you&#8217;ll think I don&#8217;t care about you.</p>


	<p>It was on the first day of our beach vacation.  I hadn&#8217;t been planning it, but we were walking along the beach, and some other folks were setting off fireworks.  I had been thinking for ages about all the things I wanted to do, like make sure that she&#8217;d love the location, and getting the perfect jewelry item.  I realized, though, that none of that mattered at all, really, and I should just ask her.  She said <strong>yes!</strong></p>


	<p>We haven&#8217;t set a date yet, although it&#8217;ll probably be fall of next year.  We&#8217;ve really just begun looking at locations, although Megan has apparently bought her dress already.</p>
