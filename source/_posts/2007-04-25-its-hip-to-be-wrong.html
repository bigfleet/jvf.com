<p>At <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000844.html">Apparently Bloggers Aren&#8217;t Journalists</a>, Coding Horror notes a situation in which a blogger makes an erroneous statement, which is then repeated by two other bloggers.

<blockquote>
The real problem is that this erroneous information was echoed by blogger B, and then echoed <i>again</i> by blogger C. <b>At no point did anyone stop to actually verify the claims of blogger A, even in the most rudimentary, basic of ways.</b> All they had to do was download the <span class="caps">SDK</span> and look for themselves to confirm that his complaints were true. I&#8217;m talking five minutes, maximum.
<p>
But they didn&#8217;t.
<p>
Instead, they blindly parroted blogger A, assumed that all of his claims were valid, and perpetuated his mistake across the internet.

	<p>In the real world, mistakes of this nature have demonstrable consequences.  Like, you&#8217;d stop trusting A, B, and C to advise you on certain matters.  In the Net world, though, without careful preventative measures (not the Net&#8217;s forte), Google&#8217;s esteem for all three bloggers will increase, making their input more valuable to parties not aware of their inaccurate or ignorant analysis in the past.</p>


	<p>Entrepreneurs and/or search whiz-kids can see $$$ in solving this problem (good luck!), but isn&#8217;t it amazing that we live in a world where being flat out wrong can be such a winning strategy?  Being a prick has always had its upside, but being <strong>wrong</strong>?</p>
