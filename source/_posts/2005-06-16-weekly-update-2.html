<li><strong>Work Going Well</strong>
<p>After spinning my wheels a bit at the first part of the week, I had a conference call with one of my users on Friday, and they loved what I&#8217;d been doing.  That always feels nice.</p></li>
<li><strong>Hit on by Quixtar</strong>
<p>They used to be Amway.  I&#8217;ve pretty much dismissed their business model, which is like a chain letter plus salesman, but I want to at least talk to these guys to see how deep the realization runs within them.</p></li>
<li><strong>Craig&#8217;s List bomb</strong>
<p><a href="http://richmond.craigslist.com/">Craig&#8217;s List</a> may be massively popular, but I don&#8217;t know how well it works.  I&#8217;ve had a ton of leads for <a href="http://richmond.craigslist.com/apa/77191366.html">the apartment</a> not even show up for the appointment.  I suppose that&#8217;s life.  Onto the <a href="http://www.styleweekly.com/">Style Weekly</a> ad this week.</li>
<li><strong>Yard Sale</strong>
<p>The yard sale went really well.  I got my media racks sold&#8212;the first time I haven&#8217;t owned any of them since 1997.  We still need to ditch some extra tables, though.</p></li>
<li><strong>Logo Bricked</strong>
<p>The logo that I had made for the business venture is pretty much unusable.  I&#8217;m going to see if I can get what I&#8217;m looking for from an alternative source.</p></li>
<li><strong>Picked out paint colors</strong>
<p>The paint colors for the new house, on the other hand, are looking <strong><span class="caps">GREAT</span></strong>.  I&#8217;ll post them when I have a chance.</p></li>
<li><strong>Finalized dates of move-in</strong>
<p>We had a chance to talk to the sellers, and everything is on schedule for them leaving early on the morning of the 24th to attend their own closing.  I&#8217;ll be able to take possession later that day!</p></li>
<li><strong>Real Estate talks</strong>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a chance to share some real estate knowledge with both a friend of a friend and a random stranger.  I really have to get a business card.  Stupid logo!  Why couldn&#8217;t you have worked out?</p></li>
