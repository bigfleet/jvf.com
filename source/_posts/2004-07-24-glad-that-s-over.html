<p>The past 72 hours have been pretty crazy.  Here&#8217;s the fallout.</p>


<ul>
<li>I was up until about 5:30 AM on Wednesday night making sure that the set of reports that my project generated for its second pilot group were as good as possible.</li>
<li>Thursday afternoon, we find a problem.  I have about six hours to regenerate all the reports, get them printed out, and get them FedExed to Ithaca, NY.  That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell</a> is, for everyone who&#8217;s not Dan.</li>
<li>My A/C adaptor quit working, and my laptop quickly ran out of batteries, so I spent the day driving and calling around Richmond to find a replacement.  Also, my cell phone mysteriously stopped working.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get them out on Thursday, so I spent Friday doing the same thing, with the knowledge that we were all out of chances.</li>
<li>It seems to have worked.  Yesterday went off without too much of a hitch, and now the reports are on the FedEx truck for delivery.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Did you know that FedEx bought Kinko&#8217;s?  Or something along those lines?  Very interesting.  Certainly helped me out!</p>
