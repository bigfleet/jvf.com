<li><p>Megan and I are still having a lot of fun together.  I met another one of her good friends, named Marta, who goes to school about a block away from Allie.  Not only did the three of us have fun, we went to an absolutely fantastic party hosted by another friend of Megan&#8217;s named Chris.  He&#8217;s a very sweet, gay, black man.  His friends say that he&#8217;s really blossomed since he&#8217;s been in Richmond, and that&#8217;s easy to believe!  He was the most gracious host, and his place was gorgeous.  I mixed a few drinks for myself and my friends, and talked to a bunch of fun, new people.  It&#8217;s been so long since I did something like that.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to go see The Magnetic Fields earlier this month.  It was a really great show.  I was expecting to hear all of <i>i</i>, their new record.  As it turned out, they played a few of the good songs off that record, a lot of <i>69 Love Songs</i>, my favorite record of theirs, and my single favorite track off one of their old records.  The sound quality was <strong>incredible</strong>, probably the best of any show I&#8217;ve ever been to.  I also saw Sufjan Stevens, which was also good.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally got the <span class="caps">OPGI</span> laptop sent back.  Of course, Chuck threatened to sue me for whatever reasons he had.  Thank goodness it&#8217;s over, that&#8217;s all I can say about that.</p></li>
