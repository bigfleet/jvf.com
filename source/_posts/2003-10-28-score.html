<p>My dad was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573221112/jimvanfleetco-20">The Art of Happiness</a> by the Dalai Lama on an airplane.  His neighbor asked him if it was any good.  That&#8217;s where it all started.</p>


	<p>Turns out he was from Rice, a religious studies major.  (He actually knows the guy who masterminded the Willie&#8217;s statue escapade!)  He was interested in my particulars since my dad said I was looking for work.  We met for dinner about a week ago and had a great interview.  I took on a little project for them, and they must have liked how that turned out, because I&#8217;m now an employee!</p>


	<p>For tax purposes, who knows exactly how it&#8217;ll look.  But I have a monthly salary, and that&#8217;s all I was looking for.  Prospects look good for long term work there.  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited.</p>
