<p>Well, <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/articles/2003/08/27/review-war-double-bill">as I predicted</a>, they&#8217;re remaking <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feature/themanchuriancandidate.html"The Manchurian Candidate</a>.   Now, a second prediction.  This one will blow blue whale, the largest mammal on earth.</p>


	<p>The central conceit has been changed from Soviet brainwashing to <i>(ready?)</i> <strong>Corporate America</strong> brainwashing.  That&#8217;s right, they don&#8217;t feel they have enough control, so they&#8217;re going to <strong>kill the President</strong>.  How ridiculous!</p>


	<p>At least Denzel could marginally fill in for Frank Sinatra, although watching Frank break out the chop-socky on the Oriental in the orginal was absolutely priceless.</p>
