<p>I recently attended the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic <span class="caps">AJAX</span></a> training session in Reston, VA.  Here&#8217;s my writeup!</p>


	<h2>The Excellent</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>I couldn&#8217;t have been more impressed with the speakers&#8217; ability to quickly incorporate our feedback into their presentation.  I was not alone, I&#8217;m sure, when I indicated that the attendees would benefit from more hands-on experience with coding in <span class="caps">AJAX</span>.  Overnight, we were granted the ability to begin experimenting with some of their presentation slides using <span class="caps">AJAX</span> techniques during their lecture!  This proved to be the ultimate bite-size morsel to accompany the more substantive formal labs.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I very much enjoyed the exposure to <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/index.html">Selenium</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/">Selenium <span class="caps">IDE</span></a> for Firefox.  I hope to be able to get more hands-on with this technology in the near future.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Although Stu was not married to the diagram they prepared outlining the various areas in which both client-side and server-side <span class="caps">AJAX</span> technologies could possibly contribute, I felt that the diagram gave me a very useful tool in evaluating any prospective <span class="caps">AJAX</span> toolkit that walks in the door.  The first thing that happened to me upon returning from this training was &#8220;Have you heard of <em><span class="caps">AJAX</span> Framework A</em> or <em><span class="caps">AJAX</span> Framework B</em>?&#8221;  The answer was that I hadn&#8217;t, but  at least I have a good rule-of-thumb for figuring out how we might best be able to use that framework.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Our login to <a href="http://www.codecite.com/">Codecite</a> works, and the presentations are available there!  This practically eliminates the need for an explicit debriefing session from me.  <strong>Wow!</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<h2>The Good</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> for providing a discount in order to purchase the Pragmatic <span class="caps">AJAX</span> book.  I had already purchased it, but now their excellent Rails Recipies book can be mine.  And I got it for cheap!</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>They&#8217;re not directly responsible, but I&#8217;m happy that <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> exists.  I would never dream of writing more than 100 lines of JavaScript without this framework in tow, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> or not.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>The Not-So-Good</h2>


	<ul>
	<li>Justin, be yourself, but you could probably calm down slightly.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>While it&#8217;s not the responsibility of the speakers or the organizers, I would have enjoyed the ability to discuss some of the application of what we were learning with my fellow classmates after hours.</li>
	</ul>
