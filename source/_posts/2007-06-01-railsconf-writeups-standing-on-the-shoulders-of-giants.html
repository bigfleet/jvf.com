<p>Adam Keys made a big splash last year with his presentation <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/6/30/2077035.html">AC/DC, Stravinsky, and Rails</a>.  Reading open-source code is one of my primary methods of learning, particularly languages in which I&#8217;m not that experienced.  So I was pretty pumped for this session.</p>


	<p>Despite Adam&#8217;s entertaining style, I thought this presentation was pretty slow apart from the rapid-fire, laugh a second intro.  (Check slide 8 for the &#8220;hottest thing he could think of.&#8221;)  I would have much preferred to see a few more examples of real code that he thought were particularly enlightening, although he has <a href="http://mvm.therealadam.com/articles/2007/05/23/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">promised to write more about that</a> in his own blog post.</p>
