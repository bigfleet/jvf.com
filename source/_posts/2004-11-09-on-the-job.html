<p>The interview process with <a href="http://www.amentra.com">Amentra</a> has been going well.  The primary concern is the amount of travel possible.  I&#8217;m at a critical point here in my life in Richmond, and unless I get a chance to stay here and continue to go out with my girl and get comfortable in my environment, I&#8217;ll end up being miserable all over again.  Not worth a paycheck.</p>


	<p>Fortunately, that&#8217;s the only downside.  The job would be very challenging, but exciting.  It&#8217;s very much a small-team, us against the problem set up.  They rely on having very good people to get the job done.  I&#8217;m confident that I&#8217;d qualify.</p>


	<p>Bill&#8217;s older brother Rob has worked here in the area, and he says that Amentra would be one of two places that he&#8217;d want to work if he were going to go the consulting route.  While I might prefer a regular position in a company, I can&#8217;t argue with the recruitment process so far.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been told to expect a call sometime today from the recruiter to help me set up a meeting with the <span class="caps">CEO</span>.  He should have a job offer and details of my first assignment, if I can impress him enough.  Here&#8217;s hoping!</p>
