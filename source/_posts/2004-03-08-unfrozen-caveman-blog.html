<li>My birthday was awesome, in terms of stuff at least.  I got more gifts than I have in the past ten years, including $300 at Ikea.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting my new apartment, whenever that happens.  I was in a new apartment the other day that made it look like you can get the surround-sound speaker wire run for yourself.  How great would that be?  Obviously, in terms of people contact, that could have been a little better.</li>
<li>The work project has gone well.  I made a pretty big mistake in one area, which I&#8217;m trying to work past.   Luckily the area I made the mistake in wasn&#8217;t the main reason I was hired, so as a result I&#8217;ve gotten to focus a little more on my main task.   As a result, I&#8217;m almost certain I&#8217;m going to deliver on time, and that will boost my karma.</li>
<li>I am debt free for the first time since &#8216;97.  It feels pretty good, but actually less good than you&#8217;d think.  Now I guess it&#8217;s time to focus on my <i>get-rich-and-famous-and-change-the-world</i> plan.</li>
<li>My music collection has been getting a fair bit of attention lately.  After recovering from a hard drive crash (man was <strong><span class="caps">THAT</span></strong> easier than it could have been!) I finished off tagging the rest of my <span class="caps">MP3</span>&#8217;s.  Now I&#8217;m looking to get my live music in order.  After my work project concludes, I consider it highly likely that I&#8217;ll be writing a web application for my own music collection, and then everyone else gets to use it.</li>
<li>I started Netflix again.  I figure it&#8217;s a cheap way to keep everyone entertained.  Start looking for those reviews to show up, and to hear from me more in general.</li>

	<p>I&#8217;m going to hold off on the post about the conference I went to this past weekend.  It went really well, in the meantime.</p>
