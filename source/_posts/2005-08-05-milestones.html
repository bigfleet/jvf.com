<p>I&#8217;ve been working hard for the past few months producing my first app with <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/">WebWork</a>.  I just passed 50 revisions in my current <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SubVersion</a> repository and 50 tickets in <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a>.  I&#8217;ve leared a good deal about <a href="http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/">JasperReports</a>, as well.  I&#8217;m confident that as my skills increase, I&#8217;ll be providing more data back to the blogosphere.</p></p>


	<p>Also, watch this space, as I&#8217;m likely to bring my personal site, blog, and this blog together into the same structure.</p>
