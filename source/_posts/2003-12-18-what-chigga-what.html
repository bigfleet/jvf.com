<p>I work for a company called <span class="caps">OPGI</span>.  Once I get a chance to actually populate the website with some interesting information, I&#8217;ll provide a link but for now, it&#8217;s a shitty page I threw together in a couple of hours.  They do a lot of work similar to what my dad did when he still ran the <a href="http://www.vanfleetgroup.com/">The Van Fleet Group</a>.</p>


	<p>The company has its operating partner, Chuck Gibbs, at the middle of everything.  He has a ton of projects going all around the world&#8212;he circumnavigated the globe in the two weeks after I was hired.  There are consultants working for him on all these different projects, and he&#8217;s just beginning to experiment with a small group of young employees.</p>


	<p>They don&#8217;t have any technical employees, so I&#8217;m the first one of those.  This puts me in a position to do the three things I&#8217;m working on currently:</p>


<dl>
<dt>Internal electronic communications</dt>
<dd>

	<p>Chuck is still using his <span class="caps">AOL</span> address, although that won&#8217;t last for much longer.  The company has no website, no e-mail addresses, no cohesive feel for working with it.  I&#8217;m going to be addressing these issues into the future, but it&#8217;s likely to be a bit of a low priority.</p>

<dt>Web application</dt>
<dd>

	<p>The web application is something I&#8217;ve been working on since the <a href="http://www.bmtmicro.com"><span class="caps">BMT</span> Micro, Inc.</a> days.  I&#8217;m trying to develop an entire development process starting from the moment you&#8217;re talking to regular people about what they want the application to do, up until the point where you deploy it to the web and write the invoice.  <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/031210.html"><span class="caps">CTC</span></a>, baby!  If it works, it&#8217;s really something that could give me an actual edge in the business world.  I&#8217;m very excited about working in this area.</p>

<dt>Consulting</dt>

	<p>It was somewhat of a surprise to find out that one of the people Chuck works with here in Richmond asked for me to come check out their department and review their processes.  So now I play two roles here, listening to technical issues raised by the <span class="caps">OPGI</span> team and making recommendations about the development process at the company.  I mean, just because I have no experience, what should that matter?</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a tough gig with a lot of ups and downs, but it&#8217;s exciting.  And since it&#8217;s ultimately something I&#8217;ll have to be quite comfortable with if I&#8217;m going to be a <span class="caps">CEO</span> myself someday, I might as well start getting experience now.</p>

	<p>Something else, huh?  There&#8217;s a lot of chances for me to learn new things and he wants me to spend time working on <span class="caps">CISV</span> issues, as well.  I couldn&#8217;t really draw up anything better for myself, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
