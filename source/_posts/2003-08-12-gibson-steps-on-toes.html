<p>And what a shock!  His film about <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=638&#38;ncid=579&#38;e=1&#38;u=/nm/20030812/en_nm/leisure_thepassion_dc">the crucifixion of Jesus</a> managed to strike a nerve.  My question, if it was shot entirely in Latin and Aramaic with no subtitles, why would they think the type of person to just start hating Jews would even want to go see it?</p>


	<p>Also, the Houston Press just did an <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/2003-07-24/news.html/1/index.html">interview with Gibson&#8217;s dad</a>.  I found it pretty interesting.</p>
