<p>I sit at the gate.  This plane will take me to <span class="caps">JFK</span>.  The plane after that one will take me to Portland, Oregon for RailsConf 2007.  I am an hour ahead of time.  I have mostly conquered my cough and runny nose.  I have an exit row window seat on the flight from <span class="caps">JFK</span> to Portland&#8212;hallelujah!</p>


	<p>I began my journey with a great deal of personal and professional self-assurance.  That won&#8217;t last long!  But I am eager to see what the next few days have in store.</p>
