<p>It just struck me that I had a great experience with a product, and didn&#8217;t let anyone know.</p>


	<p>I have four cats now, and when they decide to pee on the sofa, that&#8217;s not a happy day.  I was very worried about having our living room smelling like cat urine.</p>


	<p>I ordered a <a href="http://www.stinkypets.com/">cleaning solution recipe</a> online and it worked great.  It cost $5 and it honestly worked on our sofa.</p>


	<p>Thought I&#8217;d let everyone know.</p>
