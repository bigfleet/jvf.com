	<p>As <cite><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/quotes">Floyd Gondolli</a> once said</cite> <blockquote>I like simple pleasures, like butter in my ass, lollipops in my mouth. That&#8217;s just me. That&#8217;s just something that I enjoy.</blockquote></p>


	<p>While in the past I&#8217;ve certainly enjoyed a tad more musical variety than Joe American, so much of my musical taste essentially comes down to three questions:  Is it pretty?  Does it rock?  Does it have an enjoyable rhythm?  If an album makes me answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; to two or more of those questions, we&#8217;re in good shape.  In addition, if the record is unmistakably unique, that&#8217;s when I make room in the Top 54.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s no shame in having other criteria.  We&#8217;re all critics when it comes to music!   Some people like hip-hop and hate country.  Some people are totally into a scene and judge accordingly.  Sam Prekop&#8217;s 1999 self-titled release might not do so well on criteria such as these.  Is it a jazz record?  From the guy behind <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/?id=10047">The Sea And Cake</a>?  I thought they were a pop band?</p>


	<p>But I could care less about all that (except The Sea And Cake is really good, too).  This is a breezy record, instantly evoking those sunny spring days, before the weather really warms up.  Its shuffling rhythms and gentle guitar work calm the nerves, and Prekop&#8217;s hushed vocals don&#8217;t upset that dynamic.  There&#8217;s strings, and horns, and piano on various tracks, even some synthetic rhythms on &#8216;Faces and People&#8217;, but the album remains startlingly cohesive.  To me, it&#8217;s a big benefit to be able to enjoy a record while doing something else, and this record certainly fits that bill.</p>
