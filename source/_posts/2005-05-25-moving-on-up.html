<p>Her landlord promised an &#8220;early moveout bonus&#8221; for being out by the 25th.  She did a lot of work to get packed up over this past weekend so that we&#8217;d have a chance at it.  We scheduled the movers to come last night, then found out that the &#8220;bonus&#8221; was <em>getting your deposit back earlier!</em>  This leads to Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #46: <strong>If you are offered a bonus for moving out early, find out what it is before you prepare to claim it.</strong>  Believe me, we&#8217;ll be having more of them as we go along, then I&#8217;ll get them all together.  I&#8217;ve learned a ton about buying houses.</p>


	<p>The experience with the moving company was interesting to say the least.  Fortunately, Megan&#8217;s mother was able to be there early, since the movers were also early.  I was just on time.  At any rate, they were the only ones that I found available on short notice.  They are a &#8220;christian company&#8221;, whatever that means.  Megan&#8217;s mom said that they prayed to begin moving, and I can verify that we prayed when she left, and we prayed when we were done moving.  This seems a bit odd to me, but Megan really thought it was funny.</p>


	<p>Anyway, it was overall not a good experience.  The home office&#8217;s conversations with Megan established a price ceiling which I, of course, knew nothing about.  The movers did a competent job, but started out expensive and became more so.  There&#8217;s two tips out of this one.</p>


	<p>Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #22: <strong>Schedule your move out more than one month in advance.</strong>  I recommend Two Men And a Truck.  They don&#8217;t seem to be a franchise, but I had fantastic moves with them in both Houston and Virginia, so that&#8217;s something.  I&#8217;m calling them today.</p>


	<p>Jim&#8217;s Tips For Buying A House #9: <strong>Pack your own boxes before using movers.</strong>  Unless you already have some degree of wealth, this will bring movers into your price range.</p>


	<p>So, I&#8217;m for moving her out of there ourselves with some friendly help.  Maybe I&#8217;ll be driving the fifteen-footer soon enough!  The Pontiac Catalina gave me good training.  Imagine a car that looks like <a href="http://www.hemmings.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/classifieds.cardetail/id/2200255">this</a>, but twice as big.</p>
