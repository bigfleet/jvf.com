<dd>I had two thoughts after I finished watching this movie.  The first was that &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t believe this movie is that old!&#8221;  Besides the &#8220;Haha, look at the scary communists!&#8221; factor we have in today&#8217;s viewings, during release, this was deadly serious stuff.  But this movie is about 60% plot (which you can read about elsewhere) and 40% well-done character development.  Sinatra himself has the flattest one, but he <strong>does</strong> know kung fu.

The other was that &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this movie hasn&#8217;t been remade.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure Hollywood will get around to it at some point.  They better hurry and get Jude Law:  he&#8217;s a dead ringer for the assassin!  I couldn&#8217;t recommend this movie more highly, anything that old which stands up that well deserves at least a <strong>9.4/10</strong></dd>

<dd>This one is more famous, and has Obi-Wan Kenobi in it.  Seriously, Alec Guiness is great in this movie, playing a British major who is determined to do things the &#8220;right&#8221; way.  By the time he&#8217;s almost convinced you, you realize he&#8217;s completely delusional and that time in the &#8216;hot box&#8217; probably fried his brains.  This is another war movie where the characters have depth, the plot is compelling.  It doesn&#8217;t dig straight to the soul of man the way I feel The Thin Red Line did, for instance, but it&#8217;s still worthwhile.  I give it an <strong>8.2/10</strong></dd>
