<p>For future reference, an excellent start towards <a title="Javalobby.org - Desktop Java: Self Executing JARs ..." href="http://www.javalobby.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=15486&#38;tstart=0">developing executable JARs</a>.  I&#8217;m not totally without need for this.  It might be interesting to see if I can use it to code myself a utility to help sync up my <span class="caps">M3U</span> playlists and my <span class="caps">MP3</span> player.</p>
